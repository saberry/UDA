## The 3 Goals of Regular Expressions

## But Why?

## And Where?

## What's The Pattern?

### Pretty easy

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tibble::tibble(match = c("Mick", "Rick", "candlestick", "quick"), 
           `do not match` = c("fickleness", "unlicked", "Beck", "quickly")) |> 
  flextable::flextable()
```

### Still easy

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tibble::tibble(match = c("effusive", "fluted", "nihilistic", "suspenseful"), 
           `do not match` = c("otto", "abba", "trillion", "unfitting")) |> 
  flextable::flextable()
```

### Getting harder

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tibble::tibble(match = c("civic", "level", "rotator", "tenet"), 
           `do not match` = c("pretest", "sunburn", "springer", "gourmet")) |> 
  flextable::flextable()
```

### Are these even words?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tibble::tibble(match = c("intervisibility", "pseudoprimitivism", 
                     "micropoikilitic", "odontonosology"), 
           `do not match` = c("overregularly", "energetics", 
                        "observancy", "predisable")) |> 
  flextable::flextable()
```

## Special Symbols

```
[
]
\
^
$
.
|
?
*
+
(
)
```

Can you match everything that starts with a dollar sign?

What about multiple e's only?


### Weird Things

```
\s
\t
\n
```


## Ranges and Sets

### Letters

```
[a-z]

```

### Digits

```
[1-9]
```


### Punctuation

```
\.
\?
!
```


### Negation

```
[^aeiou]
```

### Posix Classes

```
[[:alpha:]]

[[:digit:]]

[[:lower:]]

[[:punct:]]

[[:alnum:]]

[[:space:]]

[[:word:]]

[[:blank:]]
```

## Boundaries

```
\b
\w
```

## Groupings and Backreference

```
([a-z])
\1
```

## Look Arounds

```
Ahead
a(?!b)
a(?=b)

Behind
(?<!a)b
(?<=a)b
```

Let's think about what the following might do:

```
[0-9]+(?!\.)
[0-9]+(?=\.)

(?<!\b)[A-Z]
(?<=\$)[0-9]+
```

Combining groups and look arounds provides silly power:

```
([?<=\$])([0-9]{1,50})(?=\.)*
```

## Using Regex

It might surprise you to find which has a more robust set of functions.

### R

base functions:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
test_strings <- c("Mick", "Rick", "candlestick", "quick", 
                  "fickleness", "unlicked", "Beck", "quickly")

# Find the pattern

grep(pattern = "", x = test_strings, 
     perl = TRUE, value = TRUE)

# Which position is the match?

grepl(pattern = "", x = test_strings)

# Replace the match with something else.

gsub(pattern = "", replacement = "", x = test_strings)

# Find and extract a match

regmatches(regexpr())
```

```{r}
testStrings <- c("test", "string", "123", "I'm here.")

grep("[[:blank:]]", testStrings, value = TRUE, perl = TRUE)
```


stringr functions

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(stringr)
str_which()
str_detect()
str_replace_all()
str_extract()
str_squish()
```


Here's an additional chunk of text to explore:

```{r}
wacky_text <- c("hereIam", "this is a test", 
          "I repeat, this is a test", 
          "N0. Rea11y", "anotherProblem")
```

Here's a potential solutions for breaking text into pieces:

```{r}
gsub("([a-z])([A-Z])", "\\1 \\2", wacky_text)
```


### Python

```{python}
import re

p = re.compile('([a-z])([A-Z])')

wacky_text = ["hereIam", "this is a test", 
        "I repeat, this is a test", 
        "N0. Rea11y", "anotherProblem"]

matches = list(filter(p.search, wacky_text)) 

# Match is another method, but only works at the beginning of the string

re.sub(pattern = r"([a-z])([A-Z])", # The nonsense r is denoting a raw string.
       repl = "\\1 \\2", 
       string = "hereI am")

wacky_text = [re.sub(pattern = "([a-z])([A-Z])", repl = "\\1 \\2", string = wacky_text) 
  for wacky_text in wacky_text]

re.sub(pattern = "((?<=[a-z]))([A-Z])([a-z])", 
       repl = "\\1 \\2 \\3", 
       string = "hereIam")

```

Naturally, pandas has its own set of methods:

count, replace, contains, extract, findall, match, split

```{python, eval = FALSE}
import pandas as pd

pbpData = pd.read_csv("https://eightthirtyfour.com/nba/pbp/2000-01_pbp.csv")

pbpData['event'] = pbpData.HOMEDESCRIPTION.str.extract(r"([A-Z]{3,})")
```

## Exercise

Let's take a crack at solving a problem:

```{r}
library(rvest)
library(stringr)

raven <- read_html("https://discoverpoetry.com/poems/edgar-allan-poe/the-raven/") |> 
  html_elements("p") |> 
  html_text()
```

Or if you want to have a go with Python:

```{python}
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd
import requests

raven_get = requests.get("https://discoverpoetry.com/poems/edgar-allan-poe/the-raven/")

raven_html = BeautifulSoup(raven_get.content, "html.parser")

raven_text = raven_html.find_all("p")

# Now we can use some lambda action:

raven_map = map(lambda n : raven_text[n].get_text(), range(raven_text.__len__()))

raven_df = pd.DataFrame(list(raven_map))

# You can also just use a standard for loop

for i in range(raven_text.__len__()):
  raven_text[i] = raven_text[i].get_text()
  
raven_df = pd.DataFrame(raven_text, columns = ["text"])

```

<aside>
You can do some great scraping in Python, but the constant for looping over lists gets annoying.
</aside>

So, you can see that you have some issues to handle here. Extra spaces, returns/new lines, words strung together, and even punctuation.

Once you get those issues cleaned up, extract out all of the rhyming words. You don't need to get all of them, but get as many as you can.

## A Puzzle For You

```
\(*[0-9]{3}\)*-*\s*[0-9]{3}.*[0-9]{4}
```
