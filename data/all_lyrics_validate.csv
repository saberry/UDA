disposition to sleep when abstract from their diversion and unemployed in labor thomas jefferson note on the state of virginia18788 almost 19 euroamerican intellectual of the ninteenth century can have write the precede wordsthe notion of negro inferiority be so deeply pervasive among that heir of the enlightment that the category and even the vocabulary of negro inferiority be formalize into a tedious unmodulated litany this uniformity increase rather than diminish during the course of the century as leon litwack and other have show even the abolitionist who actively oppose slavery frequently regard black as inherently inferior this help to explain the widespread popularity of colonization scheme among abolitionist and other liberals1 as for jefferson it be not surprise that he hold such idea but it be impressive that he formulate so clearly at the end of the 18 century what would become the dominant view of the negro in the 19 century in many way this father of american democracy and quite possibly of five mulatto child be a man of his time and ahead of his time2in july of 1876 exactly one century after the american declaration of independence mark twain begin write adventure of huckleberry finn a novel which illustrate trenchantly the social limitation which american civilization impose on individual freedom the book take special note of way in which racism impinge upon the life of afroamericans even when they be legally free it be therefore ironic that huckleberry finn have often be attack and even censor as a racist work i would argue on the contrary that except for melvilles work huckleberry finn be without peer among major euroamerican novel for its explicitly antiracist stance3 that who brand the book racistgenerally do so without have consider the specific form of racial discourse to which the novel respond furthermore huckleberry finn offer much much than the typical liberal defense of human dignity and protest against cruelty though it contain some such element it be much fundamentally a critique of that socially constitute fiction much notably romanticism religion and the concept of the negro which serve to justify and to disguise selfish cruel and exploitative behaviorwhen i speak of racial discourse i mean much than simply attitude about race or convention of talk about race much importantly i mean that race itself be a discursive formation which delimit social relation on the basis of allege physical differences4 race be a strategy for relegate a segment of the population to a permanent inferior status it function by insist that each race have specific definitive inherent behavioral tendency and capacity which distinguish it from other race though scientifically specious race have be powerfully effective as a ideology and as a form of social definition which serve the interest of euroamerican hegemony in america race have be deploy against numerous group include native american jew asian and even for brief period a assortment of european immigrantsfor obvious reason however the primary emphasis historically have be on define the negro as a deviant from euro american norm race in america mean white supremacy and black inferiority5 and the negro a socially constitute fiction be a generalize onedimensional surrogate for the historical reality of afroamerican people it be this reify fiction which twain attack in huckleberry finn twain adopt a strategy of subversion in his attack on race that be he focus on a numb of commonplace associate with the negro and then he systematically dramatize their inadequacy he use the term nigger and he show jim engage in superstitious behavior yet he portray jim as a compassionate shrewd thoughtful selfsacrificing and even wise man indeed his portrayal of jim contradict every claim present in jeffersons description of the negro jim be cautious he give excellent advice he suffer persistent anguish over separation from his wife and child and he even sacrifice his own sleep in order that huck may rest jim in short exhibit all quality that the negro supposedly lack twain conclusion do much than merely subvert the justification of slavery which be already long since abolish twain begin this book during the final disintegration of reconstruction and his satire on antebellum southern bigotry be also a implicit response to the negrophobic climate of the postreconstruction era berkove gollin egan esp 66102 it be trouble therefore that so many reader have completely misunderstand twain subtle attack on racismtwains use of the word nigger have provoke some reader to reject the novel see hentoff as one of the much offensive word in our vocabulary nigger remain heavily shroud in taboo a careful assessment of this term within the context of american racial discourse however will allow us to understand the particular way in which the author use it if we attend closely to twain use of the word we may find in it not just a trigger to outrage but much importantly a mean of understand the precise nature of american racism and mark twain attack on itmost obviously twain use nigger throughout the book as a synonym for slave there be ample evidence from other source that this correspond to one usage common during the antebellum period we first encounter it in reference to miss watsons big nigger name jim ch 2 this usage like the term nigger stealer clearly designate the nigger as a piece of property a commodity a slave this passage also provide the only apparent textual justification for the common critical practice of label jim nigger jim as if nigger be a part of his proper name this loathsome habit go back at less as far as albert bigelow paines biography of twain 1912 in any case nigger in this sense connote a inferior even subhuman creature who be properly own by and subservient to euroamericans both huck and jim use the word in this sense for example when huck fabricate his tale about the riverboat accident the follow exchange occur between him and aunt sallygood gracious anybody hurtnom kill a niggerwell it be lucky because sometimes people doget hurt ch 32huck have never meet aunt sally prior to this scene and in spin a lie which this strange will find unobjectionable he correctly assume that the common notion of negro subhumanity will be appropriate hucks offhand remark be intend to exploit aunt sallys attitude not to express hucks own a nigger aunt sally confirm be not a person yet this exchange be hilarious precisely because we know that huck be play upon her glib and conventional bigotry we know that hucks relationship to jim have already invalidate for him such obtuse racial notion the conception of the nigger be a socially constitute and sanction fiction and it be just as false and as absurd as hucks explicit fabrication which aunt sally also swallow wholein fact the exchange between huck and aunt sally reveal a great deal about how racial discourse operate its function be to promulgate a conception of the negro as a subhuman and expendable creature who be by definition feebleminded immoral lazy and superstitious one crucial purpose of this social fiction be to justify the abuse and exploitation of afroamerican people by substitute the essentialist fiction of negroism for the actual character of individual afroamericans hence in racial discourse every afroamerican become just another instance of the negro just another nigger twain recognize this invidious tendency of race think however and he take every opportunity to expose the mismatch between racial abstraction and real human beingsfor example when pap drunkenly inveigh against the free mulatto from ohio he be outrage by what appear to him as a crime against natural law ch 6 in the first place a free nigger be for pap a contradiction in term indeed the man clothe his demeanor his education his profession and even his silverheaded cane bespeak a social status normally achieve by only a small elite of white man he be in other word a nigger who refuse to behave like a nigger pap ludicrous protestation discredit both himself and other believer in the negro as many critic have note but it have not be sufficiently stress that pap racial view correspond very closely to that of much of his white southern contemporary in substance if not in manner of expression such view be hold not only by poor white but by all rightthinking southerner regardless of their social class indeed not even the trauma of the civil war would cure southerner of this folly furthermore pap indignation at the negros right to vote be precisely analogous to the southern backlash against the enfranchisement of afroamericans during reconstruction finally pap comment be rather mild compare to the antinegro diatribe which be begin to emerge among politician even as twain be write huckleberry finn he begin write this novel during the final day of reconstruction and it seem much than reasonable to assume that the shameful white supremacist bluster of that epoch exemplify by pap tirade inform twain critique of racism in huckleberry finn see pettit mark twain and the south 3550paps final description of this ohio gentleman as a prowl thieve infernal whiteshirted freenigger ch 6 almost totally contradict his previous description of the man as a proud elegant dignify figure yet this contradiction be perfectly consistent with pap need to reassert the negro in lieu of social reality despite the vulgarity of pap personal character his think about race be highly conventional and therefore respectable but much of us cannot respect pap view and when we reject them we reject the standard racial discourse of both 1840 and 1880a reader who object to the word nigger may still insist that twain can have avoid use it but it be difficult to imagine how twain can have debunk a discourse without use the specific term of that discourse even when twain be write his book nigger be universally recognize as a insult demean word accord to stuart berg flexner negro be generally pronounce as nigger until about 1825 at which time abolitionist begin object to that term 57 they prefer color person or person of color hence w e b du bois report that some black abolitionist of the early 1830s declare themselves unite as man not as slave as people of color not as negro 245 write a generation late in army life in a black regiment 1869 thomas wentworth higginson deplore the common use of nigger among freedman which he regard as evidence of low selfesteem 28 the objection to nigger then be not a consequence of the modern sensibility but have be common for a half century before huckleberry finn be publish the specific function of this term in the book however be neither to offend nor merely to provide linguistic authenticity much much importantly it establish a context against which jims specific virtue may emerge as explicit refutation of racist presuppositionsof course the concept of the nigger entail far much than just the deployment of certain vocabulary much of the attack on the book focus on its allege perpetuation of racial stereotype twain do indeed use racial stereotype here that practice can be excuse as characteristic of the genre of humor within which twain work frontier humor rely upon the use of stock type and consequently racial stereotype be just one of many type present in huckleberry finn yet while valid such a appeal to generic convention would be unsatisfactory because it would deny twain the credit which he deserve for the sophistication of his perception see ellison hansen lynnas a serious critic of american society twain recognize that racial discourse depend upon the deployment of a system of stereotype which constitute the negro as fundamentally different from and inferior to euroamericans as with his handle of nigger twain strategy with racial stereotype be to elaborate them in order to undermine them to be sure that critic be correct who have argue that twain use this narrative to reveal jims humanity jim however be just one individual much much importantly twain use the narrative to expose the cruelty and hollowness of that racial discourse which exist only to obscure the humanity of all afroamerican peopleone aspect of huckleberry finn which have elicit copious critical commentary be twain use of superstition see especially hoffman jims magic in 19 century racial discourse the negro be always define as inherently superstitious6 many critic therefore have cite jims superstitious behavior as a instance of negative stereotype one cannot deny that in this respect jim closely resemble the entire tradition of comic darkie see woodard and mac cann but to observe this similarity be a negligible feat the issue be do twain merely reiterate cliche or do he use this conventional pattern to make a unconventional point a close examination will show that in virtually every instance twain use jims superstition to make point which undermine rather than revalidate the dominant racial discoursethe first incident of this superstitious behavior occur in chapter 2 as a result of one of tom sawyer prank when jim fall asleep under a tree tom hang his hat on a branch subsequently jim concoct a elaborate tale about have be hex and ride by witch the tale grow much grandiose with subsequent retellings and eventually jim become a local celebrity sport a fivecent piece on a string around his neck as a talisman nigger would come mile to hear jim tell about it and he be much look up to than any nigger in that country the narrator report jims celebrity finally reach the point that jim be much ruin for a servant because he get so stick up on account of have see the devil and be ride by witch this be no doubt amuse yet whether jim believe his own tale or not and the superstitious negro thesis require us to assume that he do the fact remain that jim clearly benefit from become much a celebrity and little a servant it be his owner not jim who suffer when jims uncompensated labor diminishes7this incident have often be interpret as a example of risible negro gullibility and ignorance as exemplify by blackface minstrelsy such a read have much than a little validity but can only partially account for the implication of this scene if not for the final sentence such a account may seem wholly satisfactory but the information that jim become through his own storytelling unsuited for life as a slave introduce unexpected complication be it likely that jim have be deceive by his own creative prevarication especially give what we learn about his character subsequently or have he cleverly exploit the convention of negro superstition in order to turn a silly boy prank to his own advantageregardless of whether we credit jim with forethought in this matter it be undeniable that he turn tom attempt to humiliate him into a major personal triumph in other word tom give him a inch and he take a ell it be also obvious that he do so by exercise remarkable skill as a rhetorician by construct a fictitious narrative of his own experience jim elevate himself above his prescribe station in life by become in effect a author jim write himself a new destiny jims triumph may appear to be dependent upon the gullibility of other superstitious negro but since we have no direct encounter with them we cannot know whether they be unwitting victim of jims ruse or not a will audience need not be a totally credulous one in any case it be intelligence not stupidity which facilitate jims triumph tom may have have his chuckle but the last laugh clearly belong to jimin assess jims character we should keep in mind that forethought creativity and shrewdness be quality which racial discourse see thomas jefferson deny to the negro in that sense jims darky performance here subvert the fundamental definition of the darky for the negro be define to be a object not a subject yet do a object construct its own narrative view in this way the fact of superstition which traditionally connote ignorance and unsophistication become far little important than the end to which superstition be put this inference expose once again the inadequacy of a positivist epistemology which hold for example that a rise be a rise be a rise no one will deny the selfevidence of a tautology but a rise derive whatever mean it have from the context within which it be place include the context of traditional symbolism it be the contextualize activity not das dingansich which generate mean again and again twain attack racial essentialism by direct our attention instead to the particularity of individual action we find that jim be not the negro jim be jim and we like huck come to understand what jim be by attend to what he do in specific situationsin another instance of explicitly superstitious behavior jim use a hairball to tell hucks fortune one may regard this scene as a comical example of negro ignorance and credulity act in concert with the ignorance and credulity of a fourteenyearold white boy that read would allow one a unambiguous laugh at jims expense if one examine the scene carefully however the inadequacy of such a reductive read become apparent even if jim do believe in the supernatural power of this hairball the fact remain that much of the transaction depend upon jims quick wit for example the soothsaying aside much of the exchange between huck and jim be a exercise in wily and understate economic barter in essence jim want to be pay for his service while huck want free advice jim insist that the hairball will not speak without be pay huck who have a dollar will only admit to have a counterfeit quarter jim respond by pretend to be in collusion with huck he explain how to doctor the quarter so that anybody in town would take it in a minute let alone a hairball ch 4 but obviously it be not the hairball who will benefit from acquire and spend this counterfeit coin cf weaver and williamsin this transaction jim serve his own interest while appear to serve hucks interest he take a slug which be worthless to huck and through the alchemy of his own cleverness he contrive to make it worth twentyfive cent to himself that in antebellum america be not a bad price for tell a fortune but much importantly twain show jim self consciously subvert the prescribe definition of the negro even as he perform within the limitation of that role he remain the conventional negro by give the white boy what he want at no real cost and by consistently appear to be passive and subservient to the desire of huck and the hairball but in fact he serve his own interest all along such resourcefulness be hardly consistent with the familiar onedimensional concept of the superstitious negroand while jims read be formulaic it be hardly simpleminded he see the world as a kind of manichean universe in which force of light and darkness white and black vie for dominance pap he say be uncertain what to do tear between his white and black angel jims advice to res easy en let de ole man take his own way ch 4 turn out to be good advice because huck greatly enjoy life in the cabin despite pap fit of drunken excess this mixture of pleasure and pain be precisely what jim predict admittedly jims conceptual framework be not original nonetheless his read carry considerable force because it correspond so neatly to the dominant thematic pattern in this book and much broadly to the sort of dualistic think which inform much of twain work to take a obvious example consider the role reversal and character contrast in puddnhead wilson or the prince and the pauper and much immediately jims comment here reflect tellingly upon his situation as a black slave in racist america the slave fate be always tear between his master will and his ownin this read and other incident jim emerge as a astute and sensitive observer of human behavior both in his comment regard pap and in his subtle remark to huck jim clearly possess a subtlety and intelligence which the negro allegedly lack twain make this point much clearly in the debate scene in chapter 15 true enough much of this debate be as several critic have note conventional minstrel show banter nevertheless jim demonstrate impressive reason ability despite his factual ignorance for example in their argument over polyvoofranzy huck make a category error by imply that the difference between language be analogous to the difference between human language and cat language while jims response that man should talk like a man betray his ignorance of cultural diversity his argument be perceptive and structurally sound the humor in huck s conclusion you can not learn a nigger how to argue arise precisely from our recognition that jims argument be good than hucksthroughout the novel twain present jim in way which render ludicrous the conventional wisdom about negro character as a intelligent sensitive wily and considerate individual jim demonstrate that one race provide no useful index of one character while that point may seem obvious to many contemporary reader it be a point rarely make by nineteenthcentury euroamerican novelist indeed except for melville j w de forest albion tourgee and george washington cable white novelist virtually always portray afroamerican character as exemplification of negroness in this regard the 20 century have be little good by present us a series of glimpse which penetrate the negro exterior and reveal the person beneath it twain debunk american racial discourse for racial discourse maintain that the negro exterior be all that a negro really hasthis insight in itself be a notable accomplishment twain however do not view racism as a isolate phenomenon and it be his effort to place racism within the context of other cultural tradition which produce the much problematic aspect of his novel for it be in the final chapter the tom sawyer section which much critic consider the weak part of the book that twain link his criticism of slavery and southern romanticism condemn the cruelty which both of this tradition entail see altenbernd critic have object to this chapter on various ground some of the much common be that jim become reduce to a comic darky eg marx schmitz that tom antic undermine the seriousness of the novel and that this burlesque narrative development destroy the structural integrity of the novel much critic see this conclusion as a evasion of the difficult issue which the novel have raise there be no space here for a discussion of the structural issue but it seem to me that as a critique of american racial discourse this conclude chapter offer a harsh coherent and uncompromising indictmenttom sawyer absurd scheme to rescue jim offend because the section begin with hucks justly celebrate crisis of conscience which culminate in his resolve to free jim even if do so condemn him to hell the passage which lead to hucks decision as familiar as it be merit reexaminationi would see him stand my watch on top of hisn stead of call me so i can go on sleep and see him how glad he be when i come back out of the fog and when i come to him again in the swamp up there where the feud be and such like time and would always call me honey and pet me and do everything he can think of for me and how good he always be and at last i strike the time i save him by tell the man we have smallpox aboard and he be so grateful and say i be the good friend old jim ever have in the world and the only one he be get now and then i happen to look around and see that paper i study a minute sort of hold my breath and then say to myself all right then i will go to hell and tear it up ch31the issue here be not just whether or not huck should return a contraband8 a escape slave to its proper owner much fundamentally huck must decide whether to accept the conventional wisdom which define negro as subhuman commodity or the evidence of his own experience which have show jim to be a good and kind man and a true friendhuck make the obvious decision but his do so represent much than simply a liberal choice of conscience over social convention twain explicitly make hucks choice a sharp attack on the southern church huck scold himself here be the sunday school you can a go to it and if you would do it they would a learn you there that people that act as i would be act about that nigger go to everlasting fire ch 31 yet despite hucks anxiety his choice be obviously correct furthermore by the time that twain write this word much than twenty year of national strife include civil war and reconstruction have establish hucks conclusion regard slavery as a dominant national consensus not even reactionary southerner advocate a reinstitution of slavery since the southern church have teach that slavery be god will hucks decision flatly repudiate the churchs teaching regard slavery and implicitly it also repudiate the church as a institution by suggest that the church function to undermine not to encourage a reliance on one conscience to define negro as subhuman remove them from moral consideration and therefore justify the callous exploitation of them this view of religion be consistent with the cynical iconoclasm which twain express in letter from the earth and other of his dark works9in this context tom sawyer appear to us as a superficially charm but fundamentally distasteful interloper his action be govern not by conscience but rather by romantic convention and literary authority indeed while tom may appear to be a kind of renegade he be in essence thoroughly conventional in his value and proclivity despite all his boyish prank tom represent a kind of solid respectability a young version of the southern gentleman as exemplify by the grangerfords and the shepherdsons see hoffman form and fable 32728 hence when tom propose to help huck steal jim huck lament that tom sawyer fall considerable in my estimation only i can not believe it tom sawyer a nigger stealen ch 33 such liberate activity be proper for huck who be not respectable but not for tom who be as with the previous example however this one imply a deep criticism of the status quo hucks act of conscience which much of us would now endorse be possible only for a outsider this hardly speak good for the moral integrity of southern or american civilizationto examine tom role in the novel let us begin at the end upon learn of the fail escape attempt and jims recapture tom cry out selfrighteously turn him loose he be not no slave he be as free as any creatur that walk this earth ch 42 tom have know all along that his cruel and ludicrous scheme to rescue the capture prisoner be be enact upon a free man and indeed only his silence regard jims status allow the scheme to proceed with jims cooperation certainly neither huck nor jim would otherwise have indulge tom foolishness tom gratuitous cruelty here in the pursuit of his own amusement correspond to his little vicious prank against jim in chapter 2 and just as before twain convert tom callous mischief into a personal triumph for jimnot only have jim suffer patiently which would in truth represent a doubtful virtue jim be not uncle tom jim demonstrate his moral superiority by surrender himself in order to assist the doctor in treat his wound tormentor this be hardly the behavior which one would expect from a commodity and it be precisely jims status man or chattel which have be fundamentally at issue throughout the novel it may be true that tom lengthy juvenile antic subvert the tone of the novel but they also provide the necessary backdrop for jims noble act up to this point we have be able to admire jims good sense and to respond sentimentally to his good character this however be the first time that we see him make a significant and wholly admirable moral decision his act set him apart from everyone else in the novel except huck and modestly if not disingenuously he claim to be behave just as tom sawyer would always conscious of his role as a negro jim know good than to claim personal credit for his good deed yet the contrast between jims behavior and tom be unmistakable huck declare that jim be white inside ch 40 he apparently intend this as a compliment but tom be fortunate that jim do not behave like much of the white in the noveltwain also contrast jims selfsacrificing compassion with the cruel and meanspirited behavior of his captor emphasize that white skin do not justify claim of superior virtue they abuse jim verbally and physically and some want to lynch him as a example to other slave the moderate among them however resist point out that they can be make to pay for the destruction of private property as huck observe the people that be always the much anxious for to hang a nigger that ham not do just right be always the very one that be not the much anxious to pay for him when they have get their satisfaction out of him ch 42 as if this enforcer of white supremacy do not appear contemptible enough already twain then have the doctor describe jim as the good and much faithful nurse he have ever see despite jims resking his freedom and his obvious fatigue this vigilante do admit that jim deserve to be reward but their idea of a reward be to cease punch and curse him they be not even generous enough to remove jims heavy shackle ultimately huckleberry finn render a harsh judgment on american society freedom from slavery the novel imply be not freedom from gratuitous cruelty and racism like romanticism be finally just a elaborate justification which the adult counterpart of tom sawyer use to facilitate their exploitation and abuse of other human being tom feel guilty with good reason for have exploit jim but his final gesture of pay jim off be little a insult to jim than it be twain commentary on tom himself just as slaveholders believe that economic relation ownership can justify their privilege of mistreat other human being tom apparently believe that a economic exchange can suffice as atonement for his misdeed perhaps he find a fortydollar token much affordable than a apology but then just as tom can only set a free nigger free consider as huck say his bringingup ch 42 he similarly can hardly be expect to apologize for his prank huck by contrast be equally rich but he have apologize to jim early in the novel and this be the point of hucks final remark reject the prospect of civilization to become civilize be not just to become like aunt sally much immediately it be to become like tom sawyerjim be indeed as free as any creatur that walk this earth in other word he be a man like all man at the mercy of other mens arbitrary cruelty in a sense give twain view of freedom to allow jim to escape to the north or to have tom announce jims manumission early would be a evasion of the novel ethical insight while one may escape from legal bondage there be no escape from the cruelty of this civilization there be no promise land where one may enjoy absolute personal freedom a individual freedom be always constrain by one social relation to other people be legally free do not spare jim from gratuitous humiliation and physical suffer in the final chapter precisely because jim be still regard as a nigger even if he be as accomplish as the mulatto from ohio he would not be exempt from mistreatment furthermore since tom represent the hegemonic value of his society jims freedom amount to little much than a obligation to live by his wit and to make the good of a bad situationslavery and racism then be social evil which take their place alongside various other which the novel document such as the insane romanticism that inspire the grangerfords and shepherdsons blithely to murder each other generation after generation twain reject entirely the mystification of race and demonstrate that jim be in much way a good man than the man who regard him as their inferior but he also show how little correlation there may be between the treatment one deserve and the treatment one receivesif this conclusion sound uncontroversial from the perspective of 1984 we would do good to remember that it contradict entirely the overwhelm and optimistic consensus of 1884 and no other nineteenthcentury novel so effectively locate racial discourse within the context of a general critique of american institution and tradition indeed the novel suggest that real individual freedom in this land of the free cannot be find american civilization enslave and exploit rather than liberate it be hardly a appeal messagegiven the subtlety of mark twain approach it be not surprise that much of his contemporary misunderstand or simply ignore the novel demystification of race despite their patriotic rhetoric they like pap be unprepared to take seriously the implication of freedom justice and equality they after all espouse a ideology and a explicit language of race which be virtually identical to thomas jeffersons yet racial discourse flatly contradict and ultimately render hypocritical the egalitarian claim of liberal democracy the heart of twain message to us be that a honest person must reject one or the other but hypocrisy not honesty be our norm for too many of us continue to assert both racial distinction and liberal value simultaneously if we a century late continue to be confuse about adventure of huckleberry finn perhaps it be because we remain much deeply commit to both racial discourse and a selfdeluding optimism than we care to admitwilliams college notes1 the literature on the abolition movement and on antebellum debate regard the negro be of course voluminous george fredricksons

account of their relationship to white abolitionist 1011942 the debate over jeffersons relationship to sally hemings have rage for two century the much thorough scholarly account be by fawn brodie who suggest that jefferson do have a prolong involvement with hemings and by virginius dabney who endeavor to exonerate jefferson of such charge barbara chaseriboud present a fictionalize version of this relationship in sally hemings the first afroamerican novel clotel or the president daughter 1853 by william well brown be also base on this allege affair3 for date of composition see blair for a discussion of melvilles treatment of race carolyn karchners shadow over the promise land be especially valuable article on benito cereno by joyce adler and jean yellin be also noteworthy rayford logan and lawrence j friedman provide detail account of the racist climate in postreconstruction america emphasize the literary manifestation of such attitude friedmans discussion of george washington cable 99118 the outspoken southern liberal be very informative for a general historical overview of the period c vann woodwards work remain unsurpassed john w cell offer a provocative reconsideration of woodwards argument and joel williamsons new book document the excessively violent tendency of southern racism at the end of the century4 my use of racial discourse have some affinity to foucaults conception of discourse this be not however a strictly foucaultian read while foucaults definition of discursive practice provide one of the much sophisticate tool presently available for cultural analysis his conception of power seem to me problematic i prefer a account of power which allow for a consideration of interest and hegemony theorist such as marshall berman 3435 and catherine mac kinnon 526 have indicate similar reservation frank lentriccia however have make a provocative attempt to modify foucaultian analysis draw upon gramscis analysis of hegemony see foucault the archaeology of knowledge power knowledge esp 92108 and the history of sexuality esp 921025 this be not to discount the suffering of other group but historically the philosophical basis of western racial discourse which exist even before the european discovery of america have be the equation of good and evil with light and darkness or white and black see derrida jordan 140 and west 4765 economically the slave trade chattel slavery agricultural peonage and colorcoded wage differential have make the exploitation of africanamericans the much profitable form of racism finally afro american have long be the large american minority group consequently the primacy of the negro in american racial discourse be to use althussers term 87126 overdetermined the acknowledgment of primary status however be hardly a claim of privilege6 even the allegedly scientific work on the negro focus on superstition as a definitive trait see for example w have weatherford and jerome dowd no one have comment much scathingly on negro superstition than william h thomas who be by american definition a negro himself7 hoffman in form and fable 331 reveal a implicit understand of jims creativity

race along with all other factor id at 206a shield testify that at the height of the admission season he would frequently consult the socalled daily report that keep track of the racial and ethnic composition of the class along with other information such as residency status and gender id at 207a this be do shield testify to ensure that a critical mass of underrepresent minority student would be reach so as to realize the educational benefit of a diverse student body ibid shield stress however that he do not seek to admit any particular numb or percentage of underrepresent minority student ibiderica munzel who succeed shield as director of admission testify that critical mass mean meaningful number or meaningful representation which she understand to mean a numb that encourage underrepresent minority student to participate in the classroom and not feel isolate id at 208a209a munzel state there be no numb percentage or range of number or percentage that constitute critical mass id at 209a munzel also assert that she must consider the race of applicant because a critical mass of underrepresent minority student can not be enroll if admission decision be base primarily on undergraduate gpas and lsat score ibidthe current dean of the law school jeffrey lehman also testify like the other law school witness lehman do 319 not quantify critical mass in term of number or percentage id at 211a he indicate that critical mass mean number such that underrepresent minority student do not feel isolate or like spokesperson for their race ibid when ask about the extent to which race be consider in admission lehman testify that it vary from one applicant to another ibid in some case accord to lehmans testimony a applicant race may play no role while in other it may be a determinative factor ibidthe district court hear extensive testimony from professor richard lempert who chair the faculty committee that draft the 1992 policy lempert emphasize that the law school seek student with diverse interest and background to enhance classroom discussion and the educational experience both inside and outside the classroom id at 213a when ask about the policys commitment to racial and ethnic diversity with special reference to the inclusion of student from group which have be historically discriminate against lempert explain that this language do not purport to remedy past discrimination but rather to include student who may bring to the law school a perspective different from that of member of group which have not be the victim of such discrimination ibid lempert acknowledge that other group such as asian and jew have experience discrimination but explain they be not mention in the policy because individual who be member of that group be already be admit to the law school in significant number ibidkent syverud be the final witness to testify about the law school use of race in admission decision syverud be a professor at the law school when the 1992 admission policy be adopt and be now dean of vanderbilt law school in addition to his testimony at trial syverud submit several expert report on the educational benefit of diversity syveruds testimony indicate that when a critical mass of underrepresent minority student be present 320 racial stereotype lose their force because nonminority student learn there be no minority viewpoint but rather a variety of viewpoint among minority student id at 215ain a attempt to quantify the extent to which the law school actually consider race in make admission decision the party introduce voluminous evidence at trial rely on datum obtain from the law school petitioner expert dr kinley larntz generate and analyze admission grid for the year in question 19952000 this grid show the numb of applicant and the numb of admittees for all combination of gpas and lsat score dr larntz make cellbycell comparison between applicant of different race to determine whether a statistically significant relationship exist between race and admission rate he conclude that membership in certain minority group be a extremely strong factor in the decision for acceptance and that applicant from this minority group be give a extremely large allowance for admission as compare to applicant who be member of nonfavored group id at 218a220a dr larntz concede however that race be not the predominant factor in the law school admission calculus 12 tr 1113 feb 10 2001dr stephen raudenbush the law school expert focus on the predict effect of eliminate race as a factor in the law school admission process in dr raudenbushs view a raceblind admission system would have a very dramatic negative effect on underrepresent minority admission app to pet for cert 223a he testify that in 2000 35 percent of underrepresent minority applicant be admit ibid dr raudenbush predict that if race be not consider only 10 percent of that applicant would have be admit ibid under this scenario underrepresent minority student would have constitute 4 percent of the enter class in 2000 instead of the actual figure of 145 percent ibid321 in the end the district court conclude that the law school use of race as a factor in admission decision be unlawful apply strict scrutiny the district court determine that the law school assert interest in assemble a diverse student body be not compel because the attainment of a racially diverse class be not recognize as such by bakke and it be not a remedy for past discrimination id at 246a the district court go on to hold that even if diversity be compel the law school have not narrowly tailor its use of race to far that interest the district court grant petitioner request for declaratory relief and enjoin the law school from use race as a factor in its admission decision the court of appeal enter a stay of the injunction pend appealsitting en banc the court of appeal reverse the district court judgment and vacate the injunction the court of appeal first hold that justice powells opinion in bakke be bind precedent establish diversity as a compel state interest accord to the court of appeal justice powells opinion with respect to diversity constitute the control rationale for the judgment of this court under the analysis set forth in mark v unite state 430 u s 188 1977 the court of appeal also hold that the law school use of race be narrowly tailor because race be merely a potential plus factor and because the law school program be virtually identical to the harvard admission program describe approvingly by justice powell and append to his bakke opinion 288 f 3d 732 746 749 ca6 2002four dissent judge would have hold the law school use of race unconstitutional three of the dissenter reject the majoritys mark analysis examine the law school interest in student body diversity on the merit and conclude it be not compel the 4 dissenter write separately find it unnecessary to decide whether diversity be a compel interest because like the other dissenter 322 he believe that the law school use of race be not narrowly tailor to far that interestwe grant certiorari 537 u s 1043 2002 to resolve the disagreement among the court of appeal on a question of national importance whether diversity be a compel interest that can justify the narrowly tailor use of race in select applicant for admission to public

attack on the grind that the government can use race to remedy disadvantage cast on minority by past racial prejudice id at 325 joint opinion of brennan white marshall and blackmun concur in judgment in part and dissent in part four other justice avoid the constitutional question altogether and strike down the program on statutory ground id at 408 opinion of stevens j join by burger c j and stewart and rehnquist jj concur in judgment in part and dissent in part justice powell provide a 5 vote not only for invalidate the setaside program but also for reverse the state court injunction against any use of race whatsoever the only hold for the court in bakke be that a state have a substantial interest that legitimately may be serve by a properly devise admission program involve 323

university survive justice powells scrutinyfirst justice powell reject a interest in reduce the historic deficit of traditionally disfavored minority in medical school and in the medical profession as a unlawful interest in racial balance id at 306307 2 justice powell reject a interest in remedy societal discrimination 324 because such measure would risk place unnecessary burden on innocent 3 party

however careful to emphasize that in his view race be only one element in a range of factor a university properly may consider in attain the goal of a heterogeneous student body id at 314 for justice powell t be not a interest in simple ethnic diversity in which a specify percentage of the student body be in effect guarantee to be member of select ethnic group that 325 can justify the use of race

element ibidin the wake of our fracture decision in bakke court have struggle to discern whether justice powells diversity rationale set forth in part of the opinion join by no other justice be nonetheless bind precedent under mark in that case we explain that hen a fragment court decide a case and no single rationale explain the result enjoy the assent of five justice the hold of the court

interest in student body diversitywe first wish to dispel the notion that the law school argument have be foreclose either expressly or implicitly by our affirmativeaction case decide since bakke it be true that some language in that opinion may be read to suggest that remedy past discrimination be the only permissible justification for racebased governmental action see e g richmond v j a croson co supra at 493 plurality opinion state that unless classification base on race be strictly reserve for remedial setting they may in fact promote notion of racial inferiority and lead to a politic of racial hostility but we have never hold that the only governmental use of race that can survive strict scrutiny be remedy past discrimination nor since bakke have we directly address the use of race

of the particular qualification of each applicant and to place them on the same foot for consideration although not necessarily accord them the same weight ibidwe find that the law school admission program bear the hallmark of a narrowly tailor plan as justice powell make clear in bakke truly individualize consideration demand that race be use in a flexible nonmechanical way it follow from this mandate that university cannot establish quota for member of certain racial group or put member of that group on separate admission track see id at 315316 nor can university insulate applicant who belong to certain racial or ethnic group from the competition for admission ibid university can however consider race or ethnicity much flexibly as a plus factor in the context of individualize

attention to number without much do not transform a flexible admission system into a rigid quota ibid nor as justice kennedy posit do the law school consultation of the daily report which keep track

the chief justice concede the numb of underrepresent minority student who ultimately enroll in the law school differ substantially from their representation in the applicant pool and vary considerably for each group from year to year see post at 385 dissent opinionthat a raceconscious admission program do not operate as a quota do not by itself satisfy the requirement of individualize consideration when use race as a plus 337 factor in university admission a universitys admission program must remain flexible enough to ensure that each applicant be evaluate as a individual and not in a way that

bakke 438 u s at 318 n 52 opinion of powell j identify the denial of th right to individualize consideration as the principal evil of the medical school admission programhere the law school engage in a highly individualize holistic review of each applicant file give serious consideration to all the way a applicant may contribute to a diverse educational environment the law school afford this individualize consideration to applicant of all race there be no policy either de jure or de facto of automatic acceptance or rejection base on any single soft variable unlike the program at issue in gratz v bollinger ante p 244 the law school award no mechanical predetermine diversity bonus base on race or ethnicity see ante at 271272 distinguish a raceconscious admission program that automatically award 20 point base on race from the harvard plan which consider race but do not contemplate that any single characteristic automatically ensure a specific and identifiable contribution

constitution countenance the unprecedented deference the court give to the law school a approach inconsistent with the very concept of strict scrutinyno one would argue that a university can set up a low general admission standard and then impose heighten requirement only on black applicant similarly a university may not maintain a high admission standard and grant exemption to favor race the law school of its own choose and for its own purpose maintain a exclusionary admission system that it know produce racially disproportionate result racial discrimination be not a permissible solution to the selfinflicted wound of this elitist admission policythe majority uphold the law school racial discrimination not by interpret the people constitution but by respond to a faddish slogan of the

be subject to strict scrutiny ante at 326 before apply that standard to this case i will briefly revisit the court treatment of racial classificationsthe strict scrutiny standard that the court purport to apply in this case be first enunciate in korematsu v unite state 323 u s 214 1944 there the court hold that ressing public necessity may sometimes justify the existence of racial antagonism never can id at 216 this standard of press public necessity have much frequently be term compel governmental interest see e g regent of univ of cal v bakke 438 u s 265 299 1978 opinion of powell j a majority of the court have validate only two circumstance where press public necessity or a compel state interest can possibly justify racial discrimination by state actor first the lesson of korematsu be that national security constitute a press public necessity though the government use of race to advance that objective must be narrowly tailor 2 the court have recognize as a compel state interest a government effort to remedy 352 past discrimination for which it be responsible richmond v j a croson co 488 u s 469 504 1989the contour of press public necessity can be far discern from that interest the court have reject as base for racial discrimination for example wygant v jackson bd of ed 476 u s 267 1986 find unconstitutional a collectivebargaining agreement between a school

bollinger ante p 298 ginsburg j dissentingwhere the court have accept only national security and reject even the good interest of a child as a justification for racial discrimination i conclude that

only a social emergency rise to the level of imminent danger to life and limb can justify the constitution abhor classification base on race not only because that classification can harm favor race or

respondent bollinger et al 14 this statement must be evaluate carefully because it imply that both diversity and educational benefit be component of the law school compel state interest additionally the law school refusal to entertain certain change in its admission process and status indicate that the compel state interest it seek to validate be actually broad than may appear at first glanceundoubtedly there be other way to good the education of law student aside from ensure that the student body contain a critical mass of underrepresent minority student attain diversity whatever it mean be the 355 mechanism by which the law school obtain educational benefit not a end of itself the law school however apparently believe that only a racially mix student body can lead to the educational benefit it seek how then be the law school interest in this allegedly unique educational benefit not simply the forbid interest in racial balance ante at 330 that the majority expressly rejectsa distinction between this two idea unique educational benefit base on racial aesthetic and race for its own sake be purely sophisticso much so that the majority use them interchangeably compare ante at 328 he law school have a compel interest in attain a diverse student body with ante at 333 refer to the compel interest in secure the educational benefit of a diverse student body emphasis add the law school argument as facile as it be can only be understand in one way classroom aesthetic yield educational benefit racially discriminatory admission policy be require to achieve the right racial mix and therefore the policy be require to achieve the educational benefit it be the educational benefit that be the end or allegedly compel state interest not diversity but see ante at 332 cite the need for openness and integrity of the educational institution that provide train without reference to any consequential educational benefitsone must also consider the law school refusal to entertain change to its current admission system that may produce the same educational benefit the law school adamantly disclaim any raceneutral alternative that would reduce academic selectivity which would in turn require the law school to become a very different institution and to sacrifice a core part of its educational mission brief for respondent bollinger et al 3336 in other word the law school seek to improve marginally the education it offer 356 without sacrifice too much of its exclusivity and elite statusthe proffer interest that the majority vindicate today then be not simply diversity instead the court uphold the use of racial discrimination as a tool to advance the law school interest in offer a marginally superior education while maintain a elite institution unless each constituent part of this state interest be of press public necessity the law school use of race be unconstitutional i find each of them to fall far short of this standardiiiaa close read of the court opinion reveal that all of its legal work be do through one conclusory statement the law school have a compel interest in secure the educational benefit of a diverse student body ante at 333 no serious effort be make to explain how this benefit fit with the state interest the court have recognize or reject as compel see part i supra or to place any theoretical constraint on a enterprising court desire to discover still much justification for racial discrimination in the absence of any explanation one may expect the court to fall back on the judicial policy of stare decisis but the court eschew even this weak defense of its hold shun a analysis of the extent to which justice powells opinion in regent of univ of cal v bakke 438 u s 265 1978 357 be bind ante at 325 in favor of a unfounded wholesale adoption of itjustice powells opinion in bakke and the court decision today rest on the fundamentally flaw proposition that racial discrimination can be contextualize so that a goal such as classroom aesthetic can be compel in one context but not in another this we know it when we see it approach to evaluate state interest be not capable of judicial application today the court insist on radically expand the range of permissible use of race to something as trivial by comparison as the assemble of a law school class i can only presume that the majoritys failure to justify its decision by reference to any principle arise from the absence of any such principle see part vi infrabunder the proper standard there be no press public necessity in maintain a public law school at all and it follow certainly not a elite law school likewise marginal improvement in legal education do not qualify as a compel state interest1while legal education at a public university may be good policy or otherwise laudable it be obviously not a press public necessity when the correct legal standard be apply additionally circumstantial evidence as to whether a state activity be of press public necessity can be obtain by ask whether all state feel compel to engage in that activity evidence that state in general engage in a certain activity by no mean demonstrate that the activity constitute a press public necessity give the expansive role of government in today society the fact that some fraction of the state reject a particular enterprise however create a presumption

under appropriate circumstance demonstrate a cognizable interest in have a elite law school michigan have fail to do so herethis court have limit the scope of equal protection review to interest and

the state interest compel or not in train texas lawyer id at 6913361finally even if the law school racial tinker produce tangible educational benefit a marginal improvement in legal education cannot justify racial discrimination where the law school have no compel interest either in its existence or in its current educational and admission policiesivthe interest in remain elite and exclusive that the majority think so obviously critical require the use of admission standard that in turn create the law school need to discriminate on the basis of race the court validate this admission standard by conclude that alternative that would require a dramatic sacrifice of the academic quality of all admit student ante at 340 need not be consider before racial discrimination can be employ in the majoritys view such method be not require by the narrow tailor prong of strict scrutiny because that inquiry demand in this context that any raceneutral alternative work about as good ante at 339 quote wygant 476 u s at 280 n 6 the majority err however because raceneutral alternative must only be workable ante at 339 and do about as good in vindicate the compel state interest the court never explicitly hold that the law school desire to retain the status quo in academic selectivity be itself a compel state interest and as i have demonstrate it be not see part iiib supra therefore the law school should be force to choose between its classroom aesthetic and its exclusionary admission systemit cannot have it both wayswith the adoption of different admission method such as accept all student who meet minimum qualification 362 see brief for unite state as amicus curia 1314 the law school can achieve its vision of the racially aesthetic student body without the use of racial discrimination the law school concede this but the court hold implicitly and under the guise of narrow tailor that the law school have a compel state interest in do what it want to do i cannot agree first under strict scrutiny the law school assessment of the benefit of racial discrimination and devotion to the admission status quo be not entitle to any sort of deference ground in the first amendment or anywhere else 2 even if its academic selectivity must be maintain at all cost along with racial discrimination the court ignore the fact that other top law school have succeed in meet their aesthetic demand without racial discriminationathe court base its unprecedented deference to the law schoola deference antithetical to strict scrutinyon a idea of educational autonomy ground in the first amendment ante at 329 in my view there be no basis for a right of public university to do what would otherwise violate the equal protection clausethe constitutionalization of academic freedom begin with the concur opinion of justice frankfurter in sweezy v new hampshire 354 u s 234 1957 sweezy a marxist economist be investigate by the attorney general of new hampshire on suspicion of be a subversive the prosecution seek inter alia the content of a lecture sweezy have give at the university of new hampshire the court hold that the investigation violate due process id at 254justice frankfurter go far however reason that the first amendment create a right of academic freedom that prohibit the investigation id at 256267 opinion concur in result much of the rhetoric in justice frankfurter opinion be devote to the personal right of sweezy to free speech see e g id at 265 for a citizen to be 363 make to forego even a part of so basic a liberty as his political autonomy the subordinate interest of the state must be compel still claim that the unite state report need not be burden with proof justice frankfurter also assert that a free society depend on free university and his mean the exclusion of governmental intervention in the intellectual life of a university id at 262 accord to justice frankfurter it be the business of a university to provide that atmosphere which be much conducive to speculation experiment and creation it be a atmosphere in which there prevail the four essential freedom of a universityto determine for itself on academic ground who may teach what may be teach how it shall be teach and who may be admit to study id at 263 citation omittedin my view t be the business of this court to explain itself when it cite provision of the constitution to invent new doctrinesincluding the idea that the first amendment authorize a public university to do what would otherwise violate the equal protection clause the majority fail in its summary effort to prove this point the only source for the court conclusion that public university be entitle to deference even within the confine of strict scrutiny be justice powells opinion in bakke justice powell for his part rely only on justice frankfurter opinion in sweezy and the court decision in keyishian v board of regent of univ of state of n y 385 u s 589 1967 to support his view that the first amendment somehow protect a public universitys use of race in admission bakke 438 u s at 312 keyishian provide no answer to the question whether the 14 amendment restriction be relax when apply to public university in that case the court hold that state statute and regulation design to prevent the appointment or retention of subversive person in state employment 385 u s at 592 violate the first amendment for vagueness the statute cover all public employee and be not invalidate only as apply to university 364 faculty member although the court appear sympathetic to the notion of academic freedom call it a special concern of the first amendment id at 603 again however the court do not relax any independent constitutional restriction on public universitiesi doubt that when justice frankfurter speak of governmental intrusion into the independence of university he be think of the constitution ban on racial discrimination the majoritys broad deference to both the law school judgment that racial aesthetic lead to educational benefit and its stubborn refusal to alter the status quo in admission method find no basis in the constitution or decision of this courtb1the court deference to the law school conclusion that its racial experimentation lead to educational benefit will if adhere to have serious collateral consequence the court rely heavily on social science evidence to justify its deference see ante at 330332 but see also rothman lipset nevitte racial diversity reconsider 151 public interest 25 2003 find that the racial mix of a student body produce by racial discrimination of the type practice by the law school in fact hinder student perception of academic quality the court never acknowledge however the grow evidence that racial and other sort of

mass be indeed a very small proportionthe majority grant deference to the law school assessment that diversity will in fact yield educational benefit ante at 328 it follow therefore that a hbcs assessment that racial homogeneity will yield educational benefit would similarly be give deference a hbcs rejection of white applicant in order to maintain racial homogeneity seem permissible therefore under the majoritys view of the equal protection clause but see unite state v fordice 505 u s 717 748 1992 thomas j concur obviously a state cannot maintain tradition by close particular institution historically white or historically black to particular racial group contain within today majority opinion be the seed of a new constitutional 366 justification for a concept i think long and rightly rejectedracial segregation2moreover one would think in light of the court decision in unite state v virginia 518 u s 515 1996 that before be give license to use racial discrimination the law school would be require to radically reshape its admission process even to the point of sacrifice some element of its character in virginia a majority of the court without a word about academic freedom accept the allmale virginia military institute vmi representation that some change in its adversative method of education would be require with the admission of woman id at 540 but do not defer to vmis judgment that this change would be too great instead the court conclude that they be manageable id at 551 n 19 that case involve sex discrimination which be subject to intermediate not strict scrutiny id at 533 craig v boren 429 u s 190 197 1976 so in virginia where the standard of review dictate that great flexibility be grant to vmis educational policy than the law school deserve here this court give no deference apparently where the status quo be defend be that of the elite establishmenthere the law schoolrather than a little fashionable southern military institution the court will defer without serious inquiry and without regard to the applicable legal standardcvirginia be also notable for the fact that the court rely on the experience of formerly singlesex institution such as the service academy to conclude that admission of woman to vmi would be manageable 518 u s at 544545 today however the majority ignore the experience of that institution that have be force to abandon explicit racial discrimination in admissions367 the sky have not fall at boalt hall at the university of california berkeley for example prior to proposition 209s adoption of cal const art 1 31a which bar the state from grant preferential treatment on the basis of race in the operation of public education boalt hall enroll 20 black and 28 hispanics in its firstyear class for

httpwwwucopedu acadadvdatamgmtlawmedlawenrollseth2html total underrepresent minority student enrollment at boalt hall now exceed 1996 level apparently the law school cannot be count on to be as resourceful the court be willfully blind to the very real experience in california and elsewhere which raise the inference that institution with reputation for excellence ante at 339 rival the law school have satisfy their sense of mission without resort to prohibit racial discriminationvputting aside the absence of any legal support for the majoritys reflexive deference there be much to be say for the view that the use of test and other measure to predict academic performance be a poor substitute for a system that give every applicant a chance to prove he can succeed in the study of law the rally cry that in the absence of racial discrimination in admission there would be a true 368 meritocracy ignore the fact that the entire process be poison by numerous exception to merit for example in the national debate on racial discrimination in high education admission much have be make of the fact that elite institution utilize a socalled legacy preference to give the child of alumnus a advantage in admission this and other exception to a true meritocracy give the lie to protestation that merit admission be in fact the order of the day at the nation university the equal protection clause do not however prohibit the use of unseemly legacy preference or many other kind of arbitrary admission procedure what the equal protection clause do prohibit be classification make on the basis of race so while legacy preference can stand under the constitution racial discrimination cannot i will not twist the constitution to invalidate legacy preference or otherwise impose my vision of high education admission on the nation the majority should similarly stay its impulse to validate faddish racial discrimination the constitution clearly forbidsin any event there be nothing ancient honorable or constitutionally protect about selective admission the university of michigan should be good aware that alternative method have historically be use for the admission of student for it bring to this country the german certificate system in the late19th century see h wechsler the qualify student 1639 1977 hereinafter qualify student under this system a secondary school be certify by a university so that any graduate who complete the course offer by the school be offer admission to the university the certification regime supplement and late virtually replace at less in the midwest the prior regime of rigorous 369 subjectmatter entrance examination id at 5758 the facially raceneutral percent plan now use in texas california and florida see ante at 340 be in many way the descendent of the certificate systemcertification be replace by selective admission in the begin of the 20th century as university seek to exercise much control over the composition of their student body since its inception selective admission have be the vehicle for racial ethnic and religious tinker and experimentation by university administrator the initial drive force for the relocation of the selective function from the high school to the university be the same desire to select racial winner and loser that the law school exhibit today columbia harvard and other infamously determine that they have too many jew just as today the law school argue it would have too many white if it can not discriminate in its admission process see qualify student 155168 columbia h broun g britt christian only a study in prejudice 5354 1931 harvardcolumbia employ intelligence test precisely because jewish applicant who be predominantly immigrant score bad on such test thus columbia can claim falsely that e have not eliminate boy because they be jew and do not propose to do so we have honestly attempt to eliminate the low grade of applicant and it turn out that a good many of the low grade man be new york city jew letter from herbert e hawkes dean of columbia college to e b wilson june 16 1922 reprint in qualify student 160161 in other word the test be adopt with full knowledge of their disparate impact cf de funis v odegaard 416 u s 312 335 1974 per curiam douglas j dissentingsimilarly no modern law school can claim ignorance of the poor performance of black relatively speak on the law school admission test lsat nevertheless law school 370 continue to use the test and then attempt to correct for black underperformance by use racial discrimination in admission so as to obtain their aesthetic student body the law school continue adherence to measure it know produce racially skew result be not entitle to deference by this court see part iv supra the law school itself admit that the test be imperfect as it must give that it regularly admit student who score at or below 150 the national median on the test see app 156203 show that between 1995 and 2000 the law school admit 37 students27 of whom be black 31 of whom be underrepresent minoritieswith lsat score of 150 or low and the law school amici cannot seem to agree on the fundamental question whether the test itself be useful compare brief for law school admission council as amicus curia 12 lsat score be a effective predictor of student performance in law school with brief for harvard black law student association et al as amici curia 27 whether measure objective merit be certainly questionablehaving decide to use the lsat the law school must accept the constitutional burden that come with this decision the law school may freely continue to employ the lsat and other allegedly meritbased standard in whatever fashion it like what the equal protection clause forbid but the court today allow be the use of this standard handinhand with racial discrimination a infinite variety of admission method be available to the law school consider all of the radical think that have historically occur at this countrys university the law school intractable approach toward admission be strikingthe court will not even deign to make the law school try other method however prefer instead to grant a 25year license to violate the constitution and the same court that have the courage to order the desegregation of all public school in the south now fear on the basis of platitude 371 rather than principle to force the law school to abandon a decidedly imperfect admission regime that provide the basis for racial discriminationvithe absence of any articulate legal principle support the majoritys principal hold suggest another rationale i believe what lie beneath the court decision today be the benighted notion that one can tell when racial discrimination benefit rather than hurt minority group see adarand 515 u s at 239 scalia j concur in part and concur in judgment and that racial discrimination be necessary to remedy general societal ill this court precedent supposedly settle both issue but clearly the majority still cannot commit to the principle that racial classification be per se harmful and that almost no amount of benefit in the eye of the beholder can justify such classificationsputting aside what i take to be the court implicit rejection of adarands hold that beneficial and burdensome racial classification be equally invalid i must contest the notion that the law school discrimination benefit that admit as a result of it the court spend considerable time discuss the impressive display of amicus support for the law school in this case from all corner of society ante at 330331 but nowhere in any of the filing in this court be any evidence that the purport beneficiary of this racial discrimination prove themselves by perform at or even near the same level as that student who receive no preference cf thernstrom thernstrom reflection on the shape of the river 46 ucla l rev 1583 16051608 1999 discuss the failure of defender of racial discrimination in admission to consider the fact that its beneficiary be underperform in the classroomthe silence in this case be deafen to that of us who view high education purpose as impart knowledge and skill to student rather than a communal rubberstamp 372 credentialing process the law school be not look for that student who despite a low lsat score or undergraduate grade point average will succeed in the study of law the law school seek only a facadeit be sufficient that the class look right even if it do not perform rightthe law school tantalize unprepared student with the promise of a university of michigan degree and all of the opportunity that it offer this overmatched student take the bait only to find that they cannot succeed in the cauldron of competition and this mismatch crisis be not restrict to elite institution see t sowell race and culture 176177 1994 even if much minority student be able to meet the normal standard at the average range of college and university the systematic mismatch of minority student begin at the top can mean that such student be generally overmatched throughout all level of high education indeed to cover the track of the aestheticists this cruel farce of racial discrimination must continue in selection for the michigan law review see university of michigan law school student handbook 20022003 pp 3940 note the presence of a diversity plan for admission to the review and in hire at law firm and for judicial clerkshipsuntil the beneficiary be no long tolerate while this student may graduate with law degree there be no evidence that they have receive a qualitatively good legal education or become good lawyer than if they have go to a little elite law school for which they be good prepare and the aestheticists will never address the real problem face underrepresent minority instead continue their social experiment on other people children373 beyond the harm the law school racial discrimination visit upon its test subject no social science have disprove the notion that this discrimination engender attitude of superiority or alternatively provoke resentment among that who believe that they have be wrong by the government use of race adarand 515 u s at 241 thomas j concur in part and concur in judgment this program stamp minority with a badge of inferiority and may cause them to develop dependency or to adopt a attitude that they be entitle to preference ibidit be uncontested that each year the law school admit a handful of black who would be admit in the absence of racial discrimination see brief for respondent bollinger et al 6 who can differentiate between that who belong and that who do not the majority of black be admit to the law school because of discrimination and because of this policy all be tar as undeserving this problem of stigma do not depend on determinacy as to whether that stigmatize be actually the beneficiary of racial discrimination when black take position in the high place of government industry or academia it be a open question today whether their skin color play a part in their advancement the question itself be the stigmabecause either racial discrimination do play a role in which case the person may be deem otherwise unqualified or it do not in which case ask the question itself unfairly mark that black who would succeed without discrimination be this what the court mean by visibly open ante at 332finally the court disturb reference to the importance of the countrys law school as train ground mean to cultivate a set of leader with legitimacy in the eye of the citizenry ibid through the use of racial discrimination deserve discussion as note early the court have soundly 374 reject the remedy of societal discrimination as a justification for governmental use of race wygant 476 u s at 276 plurality opinion croson 488 u s at 497 plurality opinion id at 520521 scalia j concur in judgment for that who believe that every racial disproportionality in our society be cause by some kind of racial discrimination there can be no distinction between remedy societal discrimination and erase racial disproportionality in the countrys leadership caste and if the lack of proportional racial representation among our leader be not cause by societal discrimination then fix it be even little of a press public necessitythe court civics lesson present yet another example of judicial selection of a theory of political representation base on skin coloran endeavor i have previously reject see holder v hall 512 u s 874 899 1994 thomas j concur in judgment the majority appear to believe that broad utopian goal justify the law school use of race but he equal protection clause command the elimination of racial barrier not their creation in order to satisfy our theory as to how society ought to be organize de funis 416 u s at 342 douglas j dissentingviias the forego make clear i believe the court opinion to be in much respect erroneous i do however find two point on which i agreeafirst i note that the issue of unconstitutional racial discrimination among the group the law school prefer be not present in this case because petitioner have never argue that the law school engage in such a practice and the law school maintain that it do not see brief for respondent bollinger et al 32 n 50 and 67 n 7 i join the court opinion insofar as it confirm that this type of racial discrimination remain unlawful ante at 326327 under today 375 decision it be still the case that racial discrimination that do not help a university to enroll a unspecified numb or critical mass of underrepresent minority student be unconstitutional thus the law school may not discriminate in admission between similarly situate black and hispanics or between white and asian this be so because prefer black to hispanic applicant for instance do nothing to far the interest recognize by the majority today indeed the majority describe such racial balance as patently unconstitutional ante at 330 like the court ante at 336 i express no opinion as to whether the law school current admission program run afoul of this prohibitionbthe court also hold that racial discrimination in admission should be give another 25 year before it be deem no long narrowly tailor to the law school fabricate compel state interest ante at 343 while i agree that in 25 year the practice of the law school will be illegal they be for the reason i have give illegal now the majority do not and cannot rest its time limitation on any evidence that the gap in credential between black and white 376 student be shrink or will be go in that timeframe in recent year there have be virtually no change for example in the proportion of law school applicant with lsat score of 165 and high who be black in 1993 black constitute 11 of law school applicant in that score range though they represent 111 of all applicant law school admission council national statistical report 1994 hereinafter lsac statistical report in 2000 the comparable number be 10 and 113 lsac statistical report 2001 no one can seriously contend and the court do not that the racial gap in academic credential will disappear in 25 year nor be the court hold that racial discrimination will be unconstitutional in 25 year make contingent on the gap close in that time377 indeed the very existence of racial discrimination of the type practice by the law school may impede the narrow of the lsat test gap a applicant lsat score can improve dramatically with preparation but such preparation be a cost and there must be sufficient benefit attach to a improve score to justify additional study white score between 163 and 167 on the lsat be routinely reject by the law school and thus white aspire to admission at the law school have every incentive to improve their score to level above that range see app 199 show that in 2000 209 out of 422 white applicant be reject in this score range black on the other hand be nearly guarantee admission if they score above 155 id at 198 show that 63 out of 77 black applicant be accept with lsat score above 155 as admission prospect approach certainty there be no incentive for the black applicant to continue to prepare for the lsat once he be reasonably assure of achieve the requisite score it be far from certain that the lsat testtakers behavior be responsive to the law school admission policy nevertheless the possibility remain that this racial discrimination will help fulfill the bigot prophecy about black underperformancejust as it confirm the conspiracy theorist belief that institutional racism be at fault for every racial disparity in our societyi therefore can understand the imposition of a 25year time limit only as a hold that the deference the court pay to the law school educational judgment and refusal to change its admission policy will itself expire at that point this policy will clearly have fail to eliminat 378 the need for any racial or ethnic discrimination because the academic credential gap will still be there ante at 343 quote nathanson bartnik the constitutionality of preferential treatment for minority applicant to professional school 58 chicago bar rec 282 293 mayjune 1977 the court define this time limit in term of narrow tailor see ante at 343 but i believe this arise from its refusal to define rigorously the broad state interest vindicate today cf part ii supra with this observation i join the last sentence of part iii of the opinion of the court for the immediate future however the majority have place its imprimatur on a practice that can only weaken the principle of equality embody in the declaration of independence and the equal protection clause our constitution be colorblind and neither know nor tolerate class among citizen plessy v ferguson 163 u s 537 559 1896 harlan j dissent it have be nearly 140 year since frederick douglass ask the intellectual ancestor of the law school to o nothing with us and the nation adopt the 14 amendment now we must wait another 25 year to see this principle of equality vindicate i therefore respectfully dissent from the remainder of the court opinion and the judgmentchief justice rehnquist with whom justice scalia justice kennedy and justice thomas join dissentingi agree with the court that in the limit circumstance when draw racial distinction be permissible the government must ensure that its mean be narrowly tailor to achieve a compel state interest ante at 333 see also fullilove v klutznick 448 u s 448 498 1980 powell j concur ven if the government proffer a compel interest to support reliance upon a suspect classification the mean select must be narrowly draw to fulfill the governmental 379 purpose i do not believe however that the university of michigan law school law school mean be narrowly tailor to the interest it assert the law school claim it must take the step it do to achieve a critical mass of underrepresent minority student brief for respondent bollinger et al 13 but its actual program bear no relation to this assert goal strip of its critical mass veil the law school program be reveal as

the court decision today we consistently apply the same strict scrutiny analysis regardless of the government purport reason for use race and regardless of the set in which race be be use we reject call to use much lenient review in the face of claim that race be be use in good faith because ore than good motive should be require when government seek to allocate its resource by way of a explicit racial classification system adarand supra at 226 fullilove supra at 537 stevens j dissent racial classification be simply too pernicious to permit any but the much exact connection between

emphasize that constitutional limitation protect individual right may not be disregard bakke supra at 314although the court recite the language of our strict scrutiny analysis its application of that review be unprecedented in its deferencerespondents assert justification for the law school use of race in the admission process be obtain the educational benefit that flow from a diverse student body ante at 328 quote brief for respondent bollinger et al i they contend that a critical mass of underrepresent minority be necessary to far that interest ante at 330 respondent and school administrator explain generally that critical mass mean a sufficient numb of underrepresent minority student to achieve several objective to ensure that this minority student do not feel isolate or like spokesperson for their race to provide adequate opportunity for the type of interaction upon which the educational benefit of diversity depend and to challenge all student to think critically and reexamine stereotype see app to pet for cert 211a brief for respondent bollinger et al 26 this objective indicate that critical mass relate to the size of the student body id at 5 claim that the law school have enroll critical mass or enough minority student to provide meaningful integration of its classroom and residence hall respondent far claim that the law school be achieve critical mass id at 4 note that the law school goal have be greatly further by the presence of a critical mass of minority student in the student bodyin practice the law school program bear little or no relation to its assert goal of achieve critical mass respondent explain that the law school seek to accumulate a critical mass of each underrepresent minority 381 group see e g id at 49 n 79 the law school current policy provide a special commitment to enroll a critical mass of hispanics but the record demonstrate that the law school admission practice with respect to this group differ dramatically and cannot be defend under any consistent use of the term critical massfrom 1995 through 2000 the law school admit between 1130 and 1310 student of that between 13 and 19 be native american between 91 and 108 be africanamerican and between 47 and 56 be hispanic if the law school be admit between 91 and 108 africanamericans in order to achieve critical mass thereby prevent africanamerican student from feel isolate or like spokesperson for their race one would think that a numb of the same order of magnitude would be necessary to accomplish the same purpose for hispanics and native american similarly even if all of the native american applicant admit in a give year matriculate which the record demonstrate be not at all the case how can this possibly constitute a critical mass of native american in a class of over 350 student in order for this pattern of admission to be consistent with the law school explanation of critical mass one would have to believe that the objective of critical mass offer by respondent be achieve with only half the numb of hispanics and onesixth the numb of native american as compare to africanamericans but respondent offer no racespecific reason for such disparity instead they simply emphasize the importance of achieve critical mass without any explanation of why that concept be apply differently among the three underrepresent minority groups382 this different number moreover come only as a result of substantially different treatment among the three underrepresent minority group as be apparent in a example offer by the law school and highlight by the court the school assert that it frequently accept nonminority applicant with grade and test score low than underrepresent minority applicant and other nonminority applicant who be reject ante at 338 cite brief for respondent bollinger et al 10 specifically the law school state that ixtynine minority applicant be reject between 1995 and 2000 with at less a 35 and a 159 or high on the while a numb of caucasian and asianamerican applicant with similar or low score be admit ibidreview of the record reveal only 67 such individual of this 67 individual 56 be hispanic while only 6 be africanamerican and only 5 be native american this discrepancy reflect a consistent practice for example in 2000 12 hispanics who score between a 159160 on the lsat and earn a gpa of 300 or high apply for admission and only 2 be admit app 200201 meanwhile 12 africanamericans in the same range of qualification apply for admission and all 12 be admit id at 198 likewise that same year 16 hispanics who score between a 151153 on the lsat and earn a 300 or high apply for admission and only 1 of that applicant be admit id at 200201 twentythree similarly qualify africanamericans apply for admission and 14 be admit id at 198these statistic have a significant bear on petitioner case respondent have never offer any racespecific argument explain why significantly much individual from one underrepresent minority group be need in order to achieve critical mass or far student body diversity they certainly have not explain why hispanics who they 383 have say be among the group much isolate by racial barrier in our country should have their admission cap out in this manner brief for respondent bollinger et al 50 true petitioner be neither hispanic nor native american but the law school disparate admission practice with respect to this minority group demonstrate that its allege goal of critical mass be simply a sham petitioner may use this statistic to expose this sham which be the basis for the law school admission of little qualify underrepresent minority in preference to her surely strict scrutiny cannot permit this sort of disparity without at less some explanationonly when the critical mass label be discard do a likely explanation for this number emerge the court state that the law school goal of attain a critical mass of underrepresent minority student be not a interest in merely assur within its student body some specify percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or ethnic origin ante at 329 quote bakke 438 u s at 307 opinion of powell j the court recognize that such a interest would amount to outright racial balance which be patently unconstitutional ante at 330 the court conclude however that the law school use of race in admission consistent with justice powells opinion in bakke only pay ome attention to number ante at 336 quote bakke supra at 323but the correlation between the percentage of the law school pool of applicant who be member of the three minority group and the percentage of the admit applicant who be member of this same group be far too precise to be dismiss as merely the result of the school pay some attention to number as the table below show from 1995 through 2000 the percentage of admit applicant who be member of this minority group closely track the percentage of individual in

the admit class be africanamerican by 2000 only 75 of the applicant pool be africanamerican and 73 of the admit class be africanamerican this correlation be strike respondent themselves emphasize that the numb of underrepresent minority student admit to the law school would be significantly small if the race of each applicant be not consider see app to pet for cert 223a brief for respondent bollinger et al 6 quote app to pet for cert 299a but as the example above illustrate the measure of the decrease would differ dramatically among the group the tight correlation between the percentage of applicant and admittees of a give race therefore must result from careful race base plan by the law school it suggest a formula for admission base on the aspirational assumption that all applicant be equally qualify academically and therefore that the proportion of each group admit should be the same as the proportion of that group in the applicant pool see brief for respondent bollinger et al 43 n 70 discuss admission officer use of periodic report to track the racial composition of the develop classnot only do respondent fail to explain this phenomenon they attempt to obscure it see id at 32 n 50 the law school minority enrollment percentage diverge from the percentage in the applicant pool by as much as 177 from 19952000 but the divergence between the percentage of underrepresent minority in the applicant pool and in the enroll class be not the only relevant comparison in fact it may not be the much relevant comparison the law school cannot precisely control which of its admit applicant decide to attend the university but it can and as the number demonstrate clearly do employ racial preference in extend offer of admission indeed the ostensibly flexible nature of the law school admission program 386 that the court find appeal see ante at 337338 appear to be in practice a carefully manage program design to ensure proportionate representation of applicant from select minority groupsi do not believe that the constitution give the law school such free rein in the use of race the law school have offer no explanation for its actual admission practice and unexplained we be bind to conclude that the law school have manage its admission program not to achieve a critical mass but to extend offer of admission to member of select minority group in proportion to their statistical representation in the applicant pool but this be precisely the type of racial balance that the court itself call patently unconstitutional ante at 330finally i believe that the law school program fail strict scrutiny because it be devoid of any reasonably precise time limit on the law school use of race in admission we have emphasize that we will consider the plan duration of the remedy in determine whether a raceconscious program be constitutional fullilove 448 u s at 510 powell j concur see also unite state v paradise 480 u s 149 171 1987 in determine whether raceconscious remedy be appropriate we look to several factor include the duration of the relief our previous case have require some limit on the duration of program such as this because discrimination on the basis of race be invidiousthe court suggest a possible 25year limitation on the law school current program see ante at 343 respondent on the other hand remain much ambiguous explain that he law school of course recognize that raceconscious program must have reasonable durational limit and the 6 circuit properly find such a limit in the law school resolve to cease consider race when genuine raceneutral alternative become available brief for respondent bollinger et al 32 this discussion of a time 387 limit be the vague of assurance in truth they permit the law school use of racial preference on a seemingly permanent basis thus a important component of strict scrutinythat a program be limit in timeis casually subvertedthe court in a unprecedented display of deference under our strict scrutiny analysis uphold the law school program despite its obvious flaw we have say that when it come to the use of race the connection between the end and the mean use to attain them must be precise but here the flaw be deep than that it be not merely a question of fit between end and mean here the mean actually use be forbid by the equal protection clause of the constitutionjustice kennedy dissentingthe separate opinion by justice powell in regent of univ of cal v bakke 438 u s 265 289291 315318 1978 be base on the principle that a university admission program may take account of race as one nonpredominant factor in a system design to consider each applicant as a individual provide the program can meet the test of strict scrutiny by the judiciary this be a unitary formulation if strict scrutiny be abandon or manipulate to distort its real and accept mean the court lack authority to approve the use of race even in this modest limit way the opinion by justice powell in my view state the correct rule for resolve this case the court however do not apply strict scrutiny by try to say otherwise it undermine both the test and its own control precedentsjustice powells approval of the use of race in university admission reflect a tradition ground in the first amendment of acknowledge a universitys conception of its educational mission id at 312314 ante at 329 our precedent provide a basis for the court acceptance of a universitys consider judgment that racial diversity among 388 student can far its educational task when support by empirical evidence ante at 329331it be unfortunate however that the court take the first part of justice powells rule but abandon the 2 have approve the use of race as a factor in the admission process the majority proceed to nullify the essential safeguard justice powell insist upon as the precondition of the approval the safeguard be rigorous judicial review with strict scrutiny as the control standard bakke supra at 291 racial and ethnic distinction of any sort be inherently suspect and thus call for the much exact judicial examination this court have reaffirm subsequent to bakke the absolute necessity of strict scrutiny when the state use race as a operative category adarand constructor inc v pea 515 u s 200 224 1995 ny person of whatever race have the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to the

concur in part and concur in judgment ny racial preference must face the much rigorous scrutiny by the court the court confuse deference to a universitys definition of its educational objective with deference to the implementation of this goal in the context of university admission the objective of racial diversity can be accept base on empirical datum know to us but deference be not to be give with respect to the method by which it be pursue preferment by race when resort to by the state can be the much divisive of all policy contain within it the potential to destroy confidence in the constitution and in the idea of equality the majority today refuse to be faithful to the settle principle of strict review design to reflect this concernsthe court in a review that be nothing short of perfunctory accept the university of michigan law school law 389 school assurance that its admission process meet with constitutional requirement the majority fail to confront the reality of how the law school admission policy be implement the dissent opinion by the chief justice which i join in full demonstrate beyond question why the concept of critical mass be a delusion use by the law school to mask its attempt to make race a automatic factor in much instance and to achieve numerical goal indistinguishable from quota a effort to achieve racial balance among the minority the school seek to attract be by the court own admission patently unconstitutional ante at 330 see also bakke supra at 307 opinion of powell j it remain to point out how critical mass become inconsistent with individual consideration in some much specific aspect of the admission processabout 80 to 85 of the place in the enter class be give to applicant in the upper range of law school admission test score and grade a applicant with this credential likely will be admit without consideration of race or ethnicity with respect to the remain 15 to 20 of the seat race be likely outcome determinative for many member of minority group that be where the competition become tight and where any give applicant chance of admission be far small if he or she lack minority status at this point the numerical concept of critical mass have the real potential to compromise individual reviewthe law school have not demonstrate how individual consideration be or can be preserve at this stage of the application process give the instruction to attain what it call critical mass in fact the evidence show otherwise there be little deviation among admit minority student during the year from 1995 to 1998 the percentage of enroll minority fluctuate only by 03 from 135 to 138 the numb of minority student to whom offer be extend vary by just a slightly great magnitude of 22 from the high of 156 in 1995 to the low of 134 in 1998390 the district court rely on this uncontested fact to draw a inference that the law school pursuit of critical mass mutate into the equivalent of a quota 137 f supp 2d 821 851 ed mich 2001 admittedly there be great fluctuation among enroll minority in the precede year 19871994 by as much as 5 or 6 the percentage of minority offer however at no point fall below 12 historically define by the law school as the bottom of its critical mass range the great variance during the early year in any event do not dispel suspicion that the school engage in racial balance the datum would be consistent with a inference that the law school modify its target only twice in 1991 from 13 to 19 and then again in 1995 back from 20 to 13 the intervene year 1993 when the percentage drop to 145 can be a aberration cause by the school miscalculation as to how many applicant with offer would accept or by its redefinition make in april 1992 of which minority group be entitle to racebased preference

the narrow fluctuation band raise a inference that the law school subvert individual determination and strict 391 scrutiny require the law school to overcome the inference whether the objective of critical mass be describe as a quota or a goal it be a line draw on the basis of race and ethnic status and so risk compromise individual assessment bakke 438 u s at 289 opinion of powell j in this respect the law school program compare unfavorably with the experience of little ivy league college amicus amherst college for example inform us that the offer it extend to student of africanamerican background during the period from 1993 to 2002 range between 81 and 125 out of 950 offer total result in a fluctuation from 24 to 49 matriculate student in a class of about 425 see brief for amherst college et al as amici curia 1011 the law school insist upon a much small fluctuation both in the offer extend and in the student who eventually enroll despite have a comparable class sizethe law school have the burden of prove in conformance with the standard of strict scrutiny that it do not utilize race in a unconstitutional way adarand constructor 515 u s at 224 at the very less the constancy of admit minority student and the close correlation between the racial breakdown of admit minority and the composition of the applicant pool discuss by the chief justice ante at 380386 require the law school either to produce a convince explanation or to show it have take adequate step to ensure individual assessment the law school do neitherthe obvious tension between the pursuit of critical mass and the requirement of individual review increase by the end of the admission season much of the decision where race may decide the outcome be make during this period see supra at 389 the admission officer consult the daily report which indicate the composition of the incoming class along racial line as dennis shield director of admission from 1991 to 1996 state the far go into the season the much frequently would 392 want to look at this and see the change from daytoday this report would track exactly where st at any give time in assemble the class and so would tell the admission personnel whether they be short of assemble a critical mass of minority student shield generate this report because the law school admission policy tell him the racial makeup of the enter

daily report during the last stage in the admission process suggest there be no far attempt at individual review save for race itself the admission officer can use the report to recalibrate the plus factor give to race depend on how close they be to achieve the law school goal of critical mass the bonus factor of race would then become divorce from individual review it would be premise instead on the numerical objective set by the law schoolthe law school make no effort to guard against this danger it provide no guideline to its admission personnel on how to reconcile individual assessment with the directive to admit a critical mass of minority student the admission program can have be structure to eliminate at less some of the risk that the promise of individual evaluation be not be keep the daily consideration of racial breakdown of admit student be not a feature of affirmativeaction program use by other institution of high learn the little ivy league college for instance do not keep ongoing tally of racial or ethnic composition of their enter student see brief for amherst college et al as amici curia 10to be constitutional a universitys compel interest in a diverse student body must be achieve by a system where individual assessment be safeguard through the entire process there be no constitutional objection to the goal of 393 consider race as one modest factor among many other to achieve diversity but a educational institution must ensure through sufficient procedure that each applicant receive individual consideration and that race do not become a predominant factor in the admission decisionmaking the law school fail to comply with this requirement and by no mean have it carry its burden to show otherwise by the test of strict scrutinythe court refusal to apply meaningful strict scrutiny will lead to serious consequence by defer to the law school choice of minority admission program the court will lose the talent and resource of the faculty and administrator in devise new and fair way to ensure individual consideration constant and rigorous judicial review force the law school faculty to undertake their responsibility as state employee in this much sensitive of area with utmost fidelity to the mandate of the constitution dean allan stillwagon who direct the law school office of admission from 1979 to 1990 explain the difficulty he encounter in define racial group entitle to benefit under the law school affirmative action policy he testify that faculty member be breathtakingly cynical in decide who would qualify as a member of underrepresent minority a example he offer be faculty debate as to whether cuban should be count as hispanics one professor object on the ground that cuban be republican many academic at other law

scrutiny that be real not feign where the corrosive category of race be a factor in decisionmaking prospective student the court and the public can demand that the state and its law school prove their

in place by justice powell will be suspend for a full quarter of a century deference be antithetical to strict scrutiny not consistent with itas to the interpretation that the opinion contain its own selfdestruct mechanism the majoritys abandonment of strict scrutiny undermine this objective be the court to apply a search standard to racebased admission scheme that would force educational institution to seriously explore raceneutral alternative the court by contrast be will to be satisfy by the law school profession of its own good faith the majority admit as much we take the law school at its word that it would like nothing good than to find a raceneutral admission formula and will terminate its raceconscious admission program as soon as practicable ante at 343 quote brief for respondent bollinger et al 34if university be give the latitude to administer program that be tantamount to quota they will have few incentive to make the exist minority admission scheme transparent and protective of individual review the unhappy consequence will be to perpetuate the hostility that proper consideration of race be design to avoid the perpetuation of course would be the bad of all outcome other program do exist which will be much effective in 395 bring about the harmony and mutual respect among all citizen that our constitutional tradition have always seek they and not the program under review here should be the model even if the court default by not demand itit be regrettable the court important hold allow racial minority to have their special circumstance consider in order to improve their educational opportunity be accompany by a suspension of the strict scrutiny which be the predicate of allow race to be consider in the first place if the court abdicate its constitutional duty to give strict scrutiny to the use of race in university admission it negate my authority to approve the use of race in pursuit of student diversity the constitution

interchangeably the court refusal to address wygants rejection of a state interest virtually indistinguishable from that present by the law school be perplex if the court defer to the law school judgment that a racially mix student body confer educational benefit to all then why would the wygant court not defer to the school board judgment with respect to the benefit a racially mix faculty confer iversity for all of its devotee be much a fashionable catchphrase than it be a useful term especially when something as serious as racial discrimination be at issue because the equal protection clause render the color of one skin constitutionally irrelevant to the law school mission i refer to the law school interest as a aesthetic that be the law school want to have a certain appearance from the shape of the desk and table in its classroom to the color of the student sit at themi also use the term aesthetic because i believe it underline the ineffectiveness of racially discriminatory admission in actually help that who be truly underprivileged cf orr v orr 440 u s 268 283 1979 note that suspect classification be especially impermissible when the choice make by the state appear to redound to the benefit of that without need for special solicitude it must be remember that the law school racial discrimination do nothing for that too poor or uneducated to participate in elite high education and therefore present only a illusory solution to the challenge face our nation the law school believe both that the educational benefit of a racially engineer student body be large and that adjust its overall admission standard to achieve the same racial mix would require it to sacrifice its elite status if the law school be correct that the educational benefit of diversity be so great then achieve them by alter admission standard should not compromise its elite status the law school reluctance to do this suggest that the educational benefit it allege be not significant or do not exist at all cf u s news world report americas good graduate school 28 2004 ed place this school in the uppermost 15 in the nation the court refer to this component of the law school compel state

school in this case that even with their racial discrimination in place black man be underrepresent at the law school see abalsac guide 426 report that the law school have 46 black woman and 28 black man why do the law school not also discriminate in favor of black man over black woman give this underrepresentation the answer be again that all the law school care about be its own image among

expression of hope ibid i use a score of 165 as the benchmark here because the law school feel it be the relevant score range for applicant consideration absent race discrimination see brief for respondent bollinger et al 5 app to pet for cert 309a show that the median lsat score for all accept applicant from 19951998 be 168 id at 310a311a show the median lsat score for accept applicant be 167 for the year 1999 and 2000 university of michigan law school website available at httpwww lawumicheduprospectivestudentsadmissionsindexhtm show that the median lsat score for accept applicant in 2002 be 166 the majoritys non sequitur observation that since 1978 the numb of black that have score in this upper range on the lsat have grow ante at 343 say nothing about current trend first black participation in the lsat until the early 1990s lag behind black representation in the general population for instance in 1984 only 73 of law school applicant be black whereas in 2000 113 of law school applicant be black see lsac statistical report 1984 and 2000 today however unless black be to begin apply to law school in proportion great than their representation in the general population the growth in absolute number of high score black should be expect to plateau and it have in 1992 63 black applicant to law school have lsat score above 165 in 2000 that numb be 65 see lsac statistical report 1992 and 2000 i use the lsat as a example but the same incentive structure be in place for any admission criterion include undergraduate grade on which minority be consistently admit at threshold significantly low than white indeed during this 5year time period enrollment of native american student drop to as low as three such student any assertion that such a small group constitute a critical mass of native american be simply absurdembed share urlcopy embed copy",7

"so i break my leg doesnt matter howsince the accident ive hear plenty of brokenleg tale and im tell you i didnt realize that walk down the stair walk down hill dance in high heel or stamp your foot on the brake pedal can be so dangerous at any rate like numerous brokenlegged intellectual before me i find the prospect of three month in bed in the dine room rather seductive from a bookreading point of view and i eagerly get start great novel pile up on my table and right at the top be the adventure of huckleberry finn which im embarrass to admit i hadnt read since junior high school the novel take me a couple of day it be long than i have remember and i close the cover stun yes stun not by any mean by the artistry of the book but by the notion that this be the novel all american literature grow out of that this be a great novel that this be even a serious novelalthough huck have his fan at publication his real elevation into the pantheon be work out early in the propaganda era between 1948 and 1955 by lionel trill leslie fiedler t s eliot joseph wood krutch and some lesser light in the introduction to american and british edition of the novel and in such journal as partisan review and the new york time book review the requirement of hucks installation rapidly reveal themselves the failure of the last twelve chapter in which huck find jim imprison on the phelps plantation and tom sawyer be reintroduce and elaborate a cruel and unnecessary scheme for jims liberation have to be diminish account for or forgive after that the novel special quality have to be place in the context first of other american novel to their detriment and then of world literature the good bet here seem to be twain style and the river set and the critic invest accordingly eliot who have never read the novel as a boy trade on his own childhood beside the big river elevate huck to the boy and the mississippi to the river god therein find the sort of mythic resonance that he admire trill like the river god idea too though he didnt bother to capitalize it he also think that twain through hucks lie tell truth one of them be i kid you not that something have go out of american life after the some simplicity some innocence some peace what twain himself be proud of in the novelhis styletrilling be glad to dub not little than definitive in american literature the prose of huckleberry finn establish for write prose the virtue of american colloquial speech he be the master of the style that escape the fixity of the print page that sound in our ear with the immediacy of the hear voice the very voice of unpretentious truth the last requirement be some quality that would link huck to other though lesser american novel such as herman melvilles mobydick that would possess some profound insight into the american character leslie fiedler obligingly provide it when he read homoerotic attraction into the relationship between huck and jim point out the similarity of this to such other white mandark man friendship as that between ishmael and queequeg in mobydick and natty bumppo and chingachgook in james fenimore coopers last of the mohicansthe canonization proceed apace great novel trill 1950 great novel eliot 1950 worldclass novel lauriat lane jr 1955 sensible naysayer such as leo marx be lose in the shuffle of propaganda but in fact the adventure of huckleberry finn have little to offer in the way of greatness there be much to be learn about the american character from its canonization than through its canonizationlet me hasten to point out that like much other i do hold any grudge against huck himself hes just a boy try to survive the villain here be mark twain who know how to give huck a voice but didnt know how to give him a novel twain be clearly aware of the storys difficulty not finish with have revisit his boyhood in tom sawyer twain conceive of a sequel and begin composition while still work on tom sawyer page proof four hundred page into it have just pass cairo and exhaust much of his memory of hannibal and the upper mississippi twain put the manuscript aside for three year he be face a problem every novelist be familiar with his original conception be begin to conflict with the implication of the actual story it be at this point in the story that huck and jim realize two thing they have become close friend and they have miss the ohio river and drift into what for jim must be the much frighten territory of alldown the river the very place miss watson be go to sell him to begin with jims putative savior huck have lead him as far astray as a slave can go and the far they go the bad it be go to be for him because the ohio be not twain territory the fulfillment of jims wish would necessarily lead the novel away from the artistic integrity that twain certainly sense his first four hundred page possess he find himself write not a boy novel like tom sawyer but a man novel about real moral dilemma and growth the patina of nostalgia for a time and place missouri in the 1840s not unlike former president ronald reagans nostalgia for his own boyhood when american get along have be transform into actual long for a timeless place of friendship and freedom safe and hide on the big river but the raft have float huck and jim and their author with them into the truly dark heart of the american soul and of american history slave countrytwain come back to the novel and work on it twice again once to rewrite the chapter contain the feud between the grangerfords and the shepherdsons and late to introduce the duke and the dauphin it be with the feud that the novel begin to fail because from here on the episode be mere distraction from the true subject of the work hucks affection for and responsibility to jim the sign of this failure be everywhere as jim be push to the side of the narrative hide on the raft and confine to it while huck follow the duke and the dauphin onshore to the scene of much simple and much little philosophically tax moral dilemma such as fraud twain be by nature a improviser and he be please enough with this improvisation to continue when the duke and the dauphin finally betray jim by sell him for forty dollar huck be shock but the fact be neither he nor twain have come up with a plan that would have save jim in the end tom sawyer do thatconsiderable critical ink have flow over the year in a attempt to integrate the tom sawyer chapter with the rest of the book but it have flow in vain as leo marx point out and as much reader sense intuitively once tom reappear ost of that trait which make so appeal a hero now disappear it should be add at once that jim doesnt mind too much the fact be that he have undergo a similar transformation on the raft he be a individual man enough to denounce huck when huck make him the victim of a practical joke in the close episode however we lose sight of jim in the maze of farcical invention and the last twelve chapter be bore a sure sign that a author have lose the battle between plot and theme and be just fill in the blanksas with all bad ending the problem really lie at the begin and at the begin of the adventure of huckleberry finn neither huck nor twain take jims desire for freedom at all seriously that be they do not accord it the respect that a man passion deserve the sign of this be that not only do the two never cross the mississippi to illinois a free state but they hardly even consider it in both tom sawyer and huckleberry finn the jacksons island scene show that such a cross even in secret be both possible and routine and even though it would present legal difficulty for a escape slave this would certainly pose no much hardship than locate the mouth of the ohio and then find passage up it it be true that there can have be slave catcher in pursuit though the novel ostensibly take place in the 1840s and the fugitive slave act be not pass until 1850 but twain moral failure once huck and jim link up be never even to account for their choice to go down the river rather than across it what this reveal be that for all his lip service to real attachment between white boy and black man twain really see jim as no much than hucks sidekick homoerotic or otherwise all the claim that be routinely make for the book humanitarian power be in the end simply absurd jim be never autonomous never have a vote always find his purpose subordinate to hucks and like every good sidekick he never mind he grow ever much passive and also much affectionate as huck and the duke and the dauphin and tom and twain make ever much use of him for their own purpose but this use they make of him be not supplementary it be integral to twain whole conception of the novel twain think that hucks affection be a good enough reward for jimthe sort of meretricious critical reason that have raise hucks paltry good intention to a strategy of subversion david l smith and a convince indictment of slavery eliot precisely mirror the same sort of meretricious reason that white people use to convince themselves that they be not racist if huck feel positive toward jim and love him and think of him as a man then thats enough he doesnt actually have to act in accordance with his feeling white american always think racism be a feel and they reject it or they embrace it to much american it seem much honorable and nice to reject it so they do but they almost invariably fail to understand that how they feel mean very little to black american who understand racism as a way of structure american culture american politic and the american economy to invest the adventure of huckleberry finn with greatness be to underwrite a very simplistic and evasive theory of what racism be and to promulgate it philosophically in school and the medium as good as in academic journal surely the discomfort of many reader black and white and the censorship battle that have dog huck finn in the last twenty year be understandable in this context no matter how often the critic place in context hucks use of the word nigger they can never excuse or fully hide the deep racism of the novelthe way twain and huck use jim because they really do care enough about his desire for freedom to let that desire change their plan and to give credit to huck suggest that the only racial insight american of the 19 or 20 century be capable of be a recognition of the obviousthat black slave and free be humanernest hemingway think of himself as always once say that all american literature grow out of huck finn it undoubtedly would have be good for american literature and american culture if our literature have grow out of one of the bestselling novel of all time another american work of the 19 century uncle tom cabin which for its portrayal of a array of thoughtful autonomous and passionate black character leave huck finn far behind uncle tom cabin be publish in 1852 when twain be seventeen still live in hannibal and contribute to his brother newspaper still sympathize with the south nine year before his abortive career in the confederate army uncle tom cabin be the much popular novel of its era universally controversial in 1863 when harriet beecher stowe visit the white house abraham lincoln condescend to remark to her so this be the little lady who make this great warthe story familiar to much nineteenthcentury american either through the novel or through the many stage adaptation that sentimentalize stowes work may be sketch briefly a kentucky slave tom be sell to pay off a debt to a slave trader who take him to new orleans on the boat trip downriver tom be purchase by the wealthy augustine st clare at the behest of his daughter eva after evas death and then st clares tom be sell again this time to simon legree whose remote plantation be the site of every form of cruelty and degradation the novel be immediately read and acclaim by any numb of excellent judge charles dickens george eliot leo tolstoy george sandthe whole roster of nineteenthcentury liberal whose work we read today and try to persuade ourselves that huck finn be equal to english novelist and critic charles kingsley think uncle tom cabin the good novel ever write this writer honor stowes book for all its myriad virtue one of this be her adept characterization of a whole world of white and black who find themselves grip by slavery many of whose name have enter the american language as expressionsnot only uncle tom himself but simon legree and to a lesser extent little eva and the black child topsy the character appear one after another vivify by their attitude desire and opinion as much as by their history and their fate surely augustine st clare tom owner in new orleans be a exquisite portrayal of a humane but indecisive man who know what he be do but not how to stop it surely cassy a fellow slave whom tom meet on the legree plantation be one of the great angry woman in all of literaturenot only bitter murderous and nihilistic but also intelligent and enterprising surely the midlife spiritual journey of ophelia st clare augustines yankee cousin from selfconfident ignorance to affectionate understand be much convince as be topsys parallel journey from ignorance and selfhatred to humanity the ineffectual mr shelby and his submissive and subversive wife the slave trader haley tom wife chloe augustines wife marie legrees overseer sambo and quimbogood or evil they all liveas for tom himself we all know what a uncle tom be except we do the popular uncle tom suck up to the master and exhibit bovine patience the real uncle tom be both a realist and a man of deep principle when he be sell by mr shelby in kentucky he know enough of shelbys affair to know that what his master assert be true its tom who must go or the whole estate will be sell off for debt include tom wife and three child late on the legree estate his religious faith tell him that the great danger he find there be not to his life but to his soul his logic be impeccable he hold fast to his soul in the face of suffer in a way that even nonbelievers like myself must respect in fact tom story eerily prefigure story of spiritual solace through deep religious belief that have come out of both the soviet gulag and the nazi concentration camp in the same way that the structure of power on legrees plantation and the suffer endure there forecast and duplicate many story of recent genocidesthe power of uncle tom cabin be the power of brilliant analysis marry to great wisdom of feel stowe never forget the logical end of any relationship in which one person be the subject and the other be the object no matter how the two people feel or what their intention be the logic of the relationship be inherently tragic and trap both party until the false subjectobject relationship be end stowes much oftrepeated and potent representation of this inexorable logic be the forcible separation of family member especially of mother from child eliza face with the sale of her child harry escape across the break ice of the ohio river lucy whose tenmonthold be sell behind her back kill herself prue who have be use for breed must listen to her last child cry itself to death because her mistress wont let her save it she fall into alcoholism and thievery and be finally whip to death cassy prefigure a choice make by one of the character in toni morrisons beloved kill her last child so that it wont grow up in slavery all of this woman have be promise something by their ownerslove education the privilege and joy of raise their childrenbut owe to slavery all of this promise have be break the grief and despair this woman display be no doubt what t s eliot be think of when he superciliously label uncle tom cabin sensationalist propaganda but in fact few critic in the 19 century ever accuse stowe of make up or even exaggerate such story one group of former slave who be ask to comment on stowes depiction of slave life say that she have fail to portray the very bad and stowe herself be afraid that if she tell some of what she have hear from escape slave and other informant during her eighteen year in cincinnati the book would be too dark to find any readership at allstowes analysis do not stop with the slave owner and trader or with the slave themselves she understand perfectly that slavery be a economic system embed in america as a whole and she comment ironically on christian banker in new york whose financial dealings result in the sale of slave on northern politician who promote the capture of escape slave for the sake of the public good on minister of church who give the system a christian stamp of approval one of stowes much skillful technique be her method of weave a discussion of slavery into the dialogue of her character especially interest be a conversation mark twain can have pay attention to augustine st clare and his abolitionist cousin ophelia be discuss his failure to act in accordance with his feeling of revulsion against slavery after entertain ophelias criticism for a period augustine point out that ophelia herself be personally disgust by black people and doesnt like to come into contact with them he say you would think no harm in a child caress a large dog even if he be black custom with us do what christianity ought to doobliterates the feel of personal prejudice when ophelia take over the education of topsy a child who have suffer a much brutal previous upbringing she discover that she can do nothing with her until she take her literally to her bosom but personal relationship do not mitigate the evil of slavery ophelia make sure to give topsy her freedomstowe also understand that the real root of slavery be that it be profitable as good as customary augustine and his brother live with slavery because it be the system they know and because they havent the imagination to live without it simon legree embrace slavery because he can make money from it and because it give him even much absolute power over his worker than he can find in the north or in englandthe very heart of nineteenthcentury american experience and literature the nature and mean of slavery be finally what twain cannot face in the adventure of huckleberry finn as jim and huck drift down twain beloved river the author find himself near what must have be a crucial personal nexus how to reconcile the feel memory of boyhood with the cruel implication of the social system within which that boyhood be live he have avoid this problem for the much part in tom sawyer slave hardly impinge on the life of tom and the other boy but once twain allow jim a voice this voice must speak in counterpoint to hucks voice and must raise issue that cannot easily be resolve either personally or culturally harriet beecher stowe new englander daughter of puritan and thinker active in the abolitionist movement and in the effort to aid and educate escape slave have no such personal conflict when she sit down to write uncle tom cabin nothing about slavery be attractive to her either as a new englander or as a resident of cincinnati for almost twenty year her lack of conflict be apparent in the clarity of both the style and substance of the novelwhy then we may ask do uncle tom cabin for all its power and popularity fail to spawn american literature fail even to work as a model for how to draw passionate autonomous and interest black literary character fail to keep the focus of the american literary imagination on the central dilemma of the american experience race part of the reason be certainly that the public conversation about race and slavery that have be a feature of antebellum american life fall silent after the civil war perhaps the answer be to be find in the adventure of huckleberry finn everyone opt for the ultimate distraction light out for the territory and the reason be to be find in uncle tom cabin thats where the money wasbut so what this be only author after all and once a book be publish the author cant be hold accountable for its role in the culture for that we have to blame the citizen themselves or their teacher or their teacher the arbiter of critical taste in melodrama of beset manhood how theory of american fiction exclude woman author the scholar nina baym have already detail how the canonization of a very narrow range of white protestant middleclass male author twain hawthorne melville emerson etc have misrepresent our literary lifefirst by define the only worthy american literary subject as the struggle of the individual against society the essential quality of america come to reside in its unsettle wilderness and the opportunity that such a wilderness offer to the individual as the medium on which he may inscribe unhindered his own destiny and his own nature and then by cast woman and especially woman writer specialist in the flagrantly bad bestseller accord to leslie fiedler as the enemy in such critical reading all other theme and mode of literary expression fall out of consideration as unamerican there go uncle tom cabin there go edith wharton there go domestic life as a subject there go almost all the bestselling novelist of the 19 century and their reader who be mostly woman the real loss though be not to our literature but to our culture and ourselves because we have lose the subject of how the various social group who may not escape to the wilderness be to get along in society and in the case of uncle tom cabin the hardnosed unsentimental dialogue about race that we should have be have since before the civil war obviously uncle tom cabin be no much the last word on race relation than the brother karamazov or david copperfield be on any numb of characteristically russian or english theme and social question some of stowes idea about inherent racial characteristic white cold heartless black naturally religious and warm be bad and have be explode one of her solution to the american racial conflict that she foresee a colony in africa she late repudiate nevertheless her view about many issue be brilliant and her heart be wise she gain the respect and friendship of many man and woman of goodwill black and white such as frederick douglass the civilrights activist mary church terrill the writer and social activist james weldon johnson and web du bois what she do be find a way to talk about slavery and family power and law life and death good and evil north and south she truly believe that all american together have to find a solution to the problem of slavery in which all be implicate when her voice a courageously public voiceas demonstrate by the public argument about slavery that race throughout uncle tom cabinfell silent in our culture and be replace by the secretive voice of huck finn who acknowledge jim only when they be alone on the raft together out in the middle of the big river racism fall out of the public world and into the private one where white think it really be but black know it really isntshould huckleberry finn be teach in the school the critic of the propaganda era lay the groundwork for the universal inclusion of the book in school curriculum by declare it great although they predate the current generation of politicize english professor this be clearly a political act because the entry of huck finn into classroom set the term of the discussion of racism and american history and set them very low all you have to do to be a hero be acknowledge that your poor sidekick be human you do actually have to act in the interest of his humanity argument about censorship have be regularly turn into nonsense by appeal to hucks greatness moreover so much critical think have go into defend huck so that he can be great so that american literature can be find different from and maybe good than russian or english or french literature that the very integrity of the critical enterprise have be call into question that much reader intuitively reject the last twelve chapter of the novel on the ground of tedium or triviality be clear from the fact that so many critic have turn themselves inside out to defend them be it so mysterious that criticism have fail in our time after be so robust only a generation ago that who cannot be persuade that the adventure of huckleberry finn be a great novel have to draw some conclusioni would rather my child read uncle tom cabin even though it be far much vivid in its depiction of cruelty than huck finn and this be because stowes novel be clearly and unmistakably a tragedy no whitewash no secret but evil suffer imagination endurance and redemptionjust like life like little eva who eagerly but fearfully listen to

"the same subject continue genius or originality be for the much part some strong quality in the mind answer to and bring out some new and strike quality in natureimagination be much properly the power of carry on a give feel into other situation which must be do good accord to the hold which the feel itself have take of the mind1 in new and unknown combination the impression must act by sympathy and not by rule but there can be no sympathy where there be no passion no original interest the personal interest may in some case oppress and circumscribe the imaginative faculty as in the instance of rousseau but in general the strength and consistency of the imagination will be in proportion to the strength and depth of feel and it be rarely that a man even of lofty genius will be able to do much than carry on his own feeling and character or some prominent and rule passion into fictitious and uncommon situation milton have by allusion embody a great part of his political and personal history in the chief character and incident of paradise lose he have no doubt wonderfully adapt and heighten them but the element be the same you trace the bias and opinion of the man in the creation of the poe above the definition of genius bear universal heir to all humanity he be as one in suffer all who suffer nothing with a perfect sympathy with all thing yet alike indifferent to all who do not tamper with nature or warp her to his own purpose who know all quality with a learn spirit instead of judge of them by his own predilection and be rather a pipe for the muse finger to play what stop she pleasd than anxious to set up any character or pretension of his own his genius consist in the faculty of transform himself at will into whatever he choose his originality be the power of see every object from the exact point of view in which other would see it he be the proteus of human intellect genius in ordinary be a much obstinate and little versatile thing it be sufficiently exclusive and selfwilled quaint and peculiar it do some one thing by virtue of do nothing else it excel in some one pursuit by be blind to all excellence but its own it be just the reverse of the cameleon for it do not borrow but lend its colour to all about it or like the glowworm disclose a little circle of gorgeous light in the twilight of obscurity in the night of intellect that surround it so do rembrandt if ever there be a man of genius he be one in the proper sense of the term he live in and reveal to otter a world of his own and may be say to have invent a new view of nature he do not discover thing out of nature in fiction or fairy land or make a voyage to the moon to descry new land river or mountain in her spotty globe but see thing in nature that every one have miss before him and give other eye to see them with this be the test and triumph of originality not to show us what have never be and what we may therefore very easily never have dream of but to point out to us what be before our eye and under our foot though we have have no suspicion of its existence for want of sufficient strength of intuition of determine grasp of mind to seize and retain it rembrandts conquest be not over the ideal but the real he do not contrive a new story or character but we nearly owe to him a 5 part of paint the knowledge of chiaroscuroa distinct power and element in art and nature he have a steadiness a firm keep of mind and eye that first stand the shock of fierce extreme in light and shade or reconcile the great obscurity and the great brilliancy into perfect harmony and he therefore be the first to hazard this appearance upon canvas and give full effect to what he see and delight in he be lead to adopt this style of broad and startle contrast from its congeniality to his own feeling his mind grapple with that which afford the good exercise to its masterpowers he be bold in act because he be urge on by a strong native impulse originality be then nothing but nature and feel work in the mind a man do not affect to be original he be so because he cannot help it and often without know it this extraordinary artist indeed may be say to have have a particular organ for colour his eye seem to come in contact with it as a feel to lie hold of it as a substance rather than to contemplate it as a visual object the texture of his landscape be of the earth earthyhis cloud be humid heavy slow his shadow be darkness that may be feel a palpable obscure his light be lump of liquid splendour there be something much in this than can be account for from design or accident rembrandt be not a man make up of two or three rule and direction for acquire geniusi be afraid i shall hardly write so satisfactory a character of mr wordsworth though he too like rembrandt have a faculty of make something out of nothing that be out of himself by the medium through which he see and with which he clothe the barren subject mr wordsworth be the last man to look abroad into universality if that alone constitute genius he look at home into himself and be content with rich fineless he would in the other case be poor as winter if he have nothing but general capacity to trust to he be the great that be the much original poet of the present day only because he be the great egotist he be selfinvolved not dark he sit in the centre of his own be and there enjoy bright day he do not waste a think on other whatever do not relate exclusively and wholly to himself be foreign to his view he contemplate a wholelength figure of himself he look along the unbroken line of his personal identity he thrust aside all other object all other interest with scorn and impatience that he may repose on his own be that he may dig out the treasure of think contain in it that he may unfold the precious store of a mind for ever brood over itself his genius be the effect of his individual character he stamp that character that deep individual interest on whatever he meet the object be nothing but as it furnish food for internal meditation for old association if there have be no other be in the universe mr wordsworths poetry would have be just what it be if there have be neither love nor friendship neither ambition nor pleasure nor business in the world the author of the lyrical ballad need not have be greatly change from what he ismight still have keep the noiseless tenour of his way retire in the sanctuary of his own heart hallow the sabbath of his own thought with the passion the pursuit and imagination of other man he do not profess to sympathise but find tongue in the tree book in the run brook sermon in stone and good in everything with a mind averse from outward object but ever intent upon its own working he hang a weight of think and feel upon every trifle circumstance connect with his past history the note of the cuckoo sound in his ear like the voice of other year the daisy spread its leave in the ray of boyish delight that stream from his thoughtful eye the rainbow lift its proud arch in heaven but to mark his progress from infancy to manhood a old thorn be bury bow down under the mass of association he have wind about it and to him as he himself beautifully say the mean flowr that blow can give thought that do often lie too deep for tearsit be this power of habitual sentiment or of transfer the interest of our conscious existence to whatever gently solicit attention and be a link in the chain of association without rouse our passion or hurt our pride that be the strike feature in mr wordsworths mind and poetry other have leave and show this power before as wither burn etc but none have feel it so intensely and absolutely as to lend to it the voice of inspiration as to make it the foundation of a new style and school in poetry his strength as it so often happen arise from the excess of his weakness but he have open a new avenue to the human heart have explore another secret haunt and nook of nature sacred to verse and sure of everlasting fame compare with his line lord byrons stanza be but exaggerate commonplace and walter scotts poetry not his prose old wife fables2 there be no one in whom i have be much disappoint than in the writer here speak of nor with whom i be much dispose on certain point to quarrel but the love of truth and justice which oblige me to do this will not suffer me to blench his merit do what he can he cannot help be a originalminded man his poetry be not servile while the cuckoo return in the spring while the daisy look bright in the sun while the rainbow lift its head above the storm yet i will remember you glencairn and all that thou hast do for mesir joshua reynolds in endeavour to show that there be no such thing as proper originality a spirit emanate from the mind of the artist and shine through his work have trace raphael through a numb of figure which he have borrow from masaccio and other this be a bad calculation if raphael have only borrow that figure from other would he even in sir joshuas sense have be entitle to the praise of originality plagiarism in so far as it be plagiarism be not originality salvator be consider by many as a great genius he be what they call a irregular genius my notion of genius be not exactly the same as theirs it have also be make a question whether there be not much genius in rembrandts three tree than in all claude lorraines landscape i do not know how that may be but it be enough for claude to have be a perfect landscapepaintercapacity be not the same thing as genius capacity may be describe to relate to the quantity of knowledge however acquire genius to its quality and the mode of acquire it capacity be power over give idea combination of idea genius be the power over that which be not give and for which no obvious or precise rule can be lay down or capacity be power of any sort genius be power of a different sort from what have yet be show a retentive memory a clear understand be capacity but it be not genius the admirable crichton be a person of prodigious capacity but there be no proof that i know that he have a atom of genius his verse that remain be dull and sterile he can learn all that be know of any subject he can do anything if other can show him the way to do it this be very wonderful but that be all you can say of it it require a good capacity to play good at chess but after all it be a game of skill and not of genius know what you will of it the understand still move in certain track in which other have tread it before quick or slow with much or little comprehension and presence of mind the great skill strike out nothing for itself from its own peculiar resource the nature of the game be a thing determinate and fix there be no royal or poetical road to checkmate your adversary there be no place for genius but in the indefinite and unknown the discovery of the binomial theorem be a effort of genius but there be none show in jedediah buxtons be able to multiply 9 figure by 9 in his head if he can have multiply 90 figure by 90 instead of 9 it would have be equally useless toil and trouble3 he be a man of capacity who possess considerable intellectual rich he be a man of genius who find out a vein of new ore originality be the see nature differently from other and yet as it be in itself it be not singularity or affectation but the discovery of new and valuable truth all the world do not see the wh look at habit blind them to some thing shortsightedness to other every mind be not a gauge and measure of truth nature have her surface and her dark recess she be deep obscure and infinite it be only mind on whom she make her full impression that can penetrate her shrine or unveil her holy of holies it be only that whom she have fill with her spirit that have the boldness or the power to reveal her mystery to other but nature have a thousand aspect and one man can only draw out one of them whoever do this be a man of genius one display her force another her refinement one her power of harmony another her suddenness of contrast one her beauty of form another her splendour of colour each do that for which he be bast fit by his particular genius that be to say by some quality of mind into which the quality of the object sink deep where it find the much cordial welcome be perceive to its utmost extent and where again it force its way out from the fulness with which it have take possession of the mind of the student the imagination give out what it have first absorb by congeniality of temperament what it have attract and mould into itself by elective affinity as the loadstone draw and impregnate iron a little originality be much esteem and seek for than the great acquire talent because it throw a new light upon thing and be peculiar to the individual the other be common and may be have for the ask to any amountthe value of any work be to be judge of by the quantity of originality contain in it a very little of this will go a great way if goldsmith have never write anything but the two or three first chapter of the vicar of wakefield or the character of a village schoolmaster they would have stamp him a man of genius the editor of encyclopedia be not usually reckon the first literary character of the age the work of which they have the management contain a great deal of knowledge like chest or warehouse but the good be not their own we should as soon think of admire the shelf of a library but the shelf of a library be useful and respectable i be once apply to in a delicate emergency to write a article on a difficult subject for a encyclopedia and be advise to take time and give it a systematic and scientific form to avail myself of all the knowledge that be to be obtain on the subject and arrange it with clearness and method i make answer that as to the first i have take time to do all that i ever pretend to do as i have think incessantly on different matter for twenty year of my life4 that i have no particular knowledge of the subject in question and no head for arrangement and that the utmost i can do in such a case would be when a systematic and scientific article be prepare to write marginal note upon it to insert a remark or illustration of my own not to be find in former encyclopedia or to suggest a good definition than have be offer in the text there be two sort of write the first be compilation and consist in collect and state all that be already know of any question in the good possible manner for the benefit of the uninformed reader a author of this class be a very learn amanuensis of other people thought the 2 sort proceed on a entirely different principle instead of bring down the account of knowledge to the point at which it have already arrive it profess to start from that point on the strength of the writer individual reflection and suppose the reader in possession of what be already know supply deficiency fill up certain blank and quit the beat road in search of new tract of observation or source of feel it be in vain to object to this last style that it be disjoint disproportioned and irregular it be merely a set of addition and correction to other mens work or to the common stock of human knowledge print separately you may as good expect a continue chain of reason in the note to a book it skip all the trite intermediate level commonplace of the subject and only stop at the difficult passage of the human mind or touch on some strike point that have be overlook in previous edition a view of a subject to be connect and regular cannot be all new a writer will always be liable to be charge either with paradox or commonplace either with dulness or affectation but we have no right to demand from any one much than he pretend to there be indeed a medium in all thing but to unite opposite excellency be a task ordinarily too hard for mortality he who succeed in what he aim at or who take the lead in any one mode or path of excellence may think himself very good off it would not be fair to complain of the style of a encyclopedia as dull as want volatile salt nor of the style of a essay because it be too light and sparkle because it be not a caput mortuum so it be rather a odd objection to a work that it be make up entirely of brilliant passagesat less it be a fault that can be find with few work and the book may be pardon for its singularity the censure may indeed seem like adroit flattery if it be not pass on a author whom any objection be sufficient to render unpopular and ridiculous i grant it be good to unite solidity with show general information with particular ingenuity this be the pattern of a perfect style but i myself do not pretend to be a perfect writer in fine we do not banish light french wine from our table or refuse to taste sparkle champagne when we can get it because it have not the body of old port besides i do not know that dulness be strength or that a observation be slight because it be strike mediocrity insipidity want of character be the great fault mediocribus esse poetis non dii non homines non concessere columnaeneither be this privilege allow to prosewriters in our time any much than to poet formerlyit be not then acuteness of organ or extent of capacity that constitute rare genius or produce the much exquisite model of art but a intense sympathy with some one beauty or distinguish characteristic in nature irritability alone or the interest take in certain thing may supply the place of genius in weak and otherwise ordinary mind as there be certain instrument fit to perform certain kind of labour there be certain mind so frame as to produce certain chefdoeuvres in art and literature which be surely the good use they can be put to if a man have all sort of instrument in his shop and want one he would rather have that one than be supply with a double set of all the other if he have them twice over he can only do what he can do as it be whereas without that one he perhaps cannot finish any one work he have in hand so if a man can do one thing good than anybody else the value of this one thing be what he must stand or fall by and his be able to do a hundred other thing merely as good as anybody else would not alter the sentence or add to his respectability on the contrary his be able to do so many other thing good would probably interfere with and encumber him in the execution of the only thing that other cannot do as good as he and so far be a drawback and a disadvantage much people in fact fail from a multiplicity of talent and pretension than from a absolute poverty of resource i have give instance of this elsewhere perhaps shakespears tragedy would in some respect have be good if he have never write comedy at all and in that case his comedy may good have be spare though they must have cost us some regret racine it be say may have rival moliere in comedy but he give up the cultivation of his comic talent to devote himself wholly to the tragic muse if as the french tell us he in consequence attain to the perfection of tragic composition this be good than write comedy as good as moliere and tragedy as good as crebillon yet i count that person fool who think it a pity hogarth do not succeed good in serious subject the division of labour be a excellent principle in taste as good as in mechanic without this i find from adam smith we can not have a pin make to the degree of perfection it be we do not on any rational scheme of criticism inquire into the variety of a man excellence or the numb of his work or his facility of production venice preserve be sufficient for otways fame i hate all that nonsensical story about lope de vega and his write a play in a morning before breakfast he have time enough to do it after if a man leave behind him any work which be a model in its kind we have no right to ask whether he can do anything else or how he do it or how long he be about it all that talent which be not necessary to the actual quantity of excellence exist in the world lose its object be so much waste talent or talent to let i hear a sensible man say he should like to do some one thing good than all the rest of the world and in everything else to be like all the rest of the world why should a man do much than his part the rest be vanity and vexation of spirit we look with jealous and grudge eye at all that qualification which be not essential first because they be superfluous and next because we suspect they will be prejudicial why do mr kean play all that harlequin trick of sing dance fence etc they say it be for his benefit it be not for his reputation garrick indeed shine equally in comedy and tragedy but he be first not secondrate in both there be not a great impertinence than to ask if a man be clever out of his profession i have hear of people try to crossexamine mrs siddons i would as soon try to entrap one of the elgin marble into a argument good nature and common sense be require from all people but one proud distinction be enough for any one individual to possess or to aspire tofootnotes1 i do not here speak of the figurative or fanciful exercise of the imagination which consist in find out some strike object or image to illustrate another2 mr wordsworth himself should not say this and yet i be not sure he would not3 the only good thing i have ever hear come of this man singular faculty of memory be the follow a gentleman be mention his have be send up to london from the place where he live to see garrick act when he go back into the country he be ask what he think of the player and the play oh he say he do not know he have only see a little man strut about the stage and repeat 7956 word one hand to his forehead and seem mightily delight call out ay indeed and pray be he find to be correct this be the supererogation of literal matteroffact curiosity jedediah buxtons count the numb of word be idle enough but here be a

special appeal quote from hazel 221 md at 469 note thatforce be a essential element of the crime and to justify a conviction the evidence must warrant a conclusion either that the victim resist and her resistance be overcome by force or that she be prevent from resist by threat to her safetywriting for the majority judge thompson saidin all of the victim testimony we have be unable to see any resistance on her part to the sex act and certainly can we see no fear as would overcome her attempt to resist or escape as require by hazel possession of the key by the accuse may have deter her vehicular escape but hardly a departure seek help in the room house or in the street we must say that the way he look fail utterly to support the fear require by hazel 43 md app at the court of special appeal interpret hazel as require a show of a reasonable apprehension of fear in instance where the prosecutrix do not resist it concludedwe find the evidence legally insufficient to warrant a conclusion that appellant word or action create in the mind of the victim a reasonable fear that if she resist he would have harm her or that face with such resistance he would have use force to overcome it the prosecutrix state that she be afraid and submit because of the look in his eye after both be undress and in the bed and she plead to him that she want to leave he start to lightly choke her at oral argument it be bring out that the lightly choke can have be a heavy caress we do not believe that lightly choke along with all the fact and circumstance in the case be sufficient to cause a reasonable fear which overcome her ability to resist in the absence of any other evidence show force use by appellant we find that the evidence be insufficient to convict appellant of rape id at 484in argument before us on the merit of the case the party agree that the issue be whether in light of the principle of hazel there be evidence before the jury legally sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the intercourse be y force or threat of force against the will and without the consent of the victim in violation of art 27 463 a 1 of course due process requirement mandate that a criminal conviction not be obtain if the evidence do not reasonably support a find of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt tichnell v state 287 md 695 415 a2d 830 1980 however as the supreme court make clear in jackson v virginia 443 us 307 99 sct 2781 61 led2d 560 1979 the review court do not ask itself whether it believe that the evidence establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt rather the applicable standard be whether after view the evidence in the light much favorable to the prosecution any rational trier of fact can have find the essential element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt 443 us at 319 emphasis in originalthe vaginal intercourse once be establish the remain element of rape in the 2 degree under 463 a 1 be as in a prosecution for common law rape 1 force actual or constructive and 2 lack of consent the term in 463 a 1 force threat of force against the will and without the consent be not define in the statute but be to be afford their judicially determine mean as apply in case involve common law rape see art 27 464e in this regard it be good settle that the term against the will and without the consent be synonymous in the law of rapehazel which be decide in 1960 long before the enactment of 463 a 1 involve a prosecution for common law rape there define as the act of a man have unlawful carnal knowledge of a female over the age of ten year by force without the consent and against the will of the victim 221 md at 46869 the evidence in that case disclose that hazel follow the prosecutrix into her home while she be unload grocery from her car he put his arm around her neck say he have a gun and threaten to shoot her baby if she move although the prosecutrix never see a gun hazel keep one hand in his pocket and repeatedly state that he have a gun he rob the prosecutrix tie her hand gag her and take her into the cellar the prosecutrix comply with hazel command to lie on the floor and to raise her leg hazel proceed to have intercourse with her while her hand be still tie the victim testify that she do not struggle because she be afraid for her life there be evidence that she tell the police that hazel do not use force at any time and be extremely gentle hazel claim that the intercourse be consensual and that he never make any threat the court say that the issue before it be whether the evidence be insufficient to sustain the conviction of rape because the conduct of the prosecutrix be such as to render her failure to resist consent in law id at 468 it be in the context of this evidentiary background that the court set forth the principle of law which control the disposition of the case it recognize that force and lack of consent be distinct element of the crime of rape it saidforce be a essential element of the crime and to justify a conviction the evidence must warrant a conclusion either that the victim resist and her resistance be overcome by force or that she be prevent from resist by threat to her safety but no particular amount of force either actual or constructive be require to constitute rape necessarily that fact must depend upon the prevail circumstance as in this case force may exist without violence if the act and threat of the defendant be reasonably calculate to create in the mind of the victim have regard to the circumstance in which she be place a real apprehension due to fear of imminent bodily harm serious enough to impair or overcome her will to resist then such act and threat be the equivalent of force id at 469as to the element of lack of consent the court say in hazelt be true of course that however reluctantly give consent to the act at any time prior to penetration deprive the subsequent intercourse of its criminal character there be however a wide difference between consent and a submission to the act consent may involve submission but submission do not necessarily imply consent furthermore submission to a compel force or as a result of be put in fear be not consentidthe court note that lack of consent be generally establish through proof of resistance or by proof that the victim fail to resist because of fear the degree of fear necessary to obviate the need to prove resistance and thereby establish lack of consent be define in the follow mannerthe kind of fear which would render resistance by a woman unnecessary to support a conviction of rape include but be not necessarily limit to a fear of death or serious bodily harm or a fear so extreme as to preclude resistance or a fear which would good nigh render her mind incapable of continue to resist or a fear that so overpower her that she do not dare resist id at 470hazel thus make it clear that lack of consent can be establish through proof that the victim submit as a result of fear of imminent death or serious bodily harm in addition if the action and conduct of the defendant be reasonably calculate to induce this fear in the victim mind then the element of force be present hazel recognize therefore that the same kind of evidence may be use in establish both force and nonconsent particularly when a threat rather than actual force be involvedthe court note in hazel that the judge who hear the evidence and who sit as the trier of fact in hazel nonjury case have conclude that in light of the defendant act of violence and threat of serious harm there exist a genuine and continue fear of such harm on the victim part so that the ensue act of sexual intercourse under this fear amount to a felonious and forcible act of the defendant against the will and consent of the prosecute witness in find the evidence sufficient to sustain the conviction the court observe that he issue of whether the intercourse be accomplish by force and against the will and consent of the victim be one of credibility properly to be resolve by the trial court 221 md at 470hazel do not expressly determine whether the victim fear must be reasonable its only reference to reasonableness relate to whether the act and threat of the defendant be reasonably calculate to create in the mind of the victim a real apprehension due to fear of imminent bodily harm 221 md at 469 manifestly the court be there refer to the calculation of the accuse not to the fear of the victim while hazel make it clear that the victim fear have to be genuine it do not pass upon whether a real but unreasonable fear of imminent death or serious bodily harm would suffice the vast majority of jurisdiction have require that the victim fear be reasonably ground in order to obviate the need for either proof of actual force on the part of the assailant or physical resistance on the part of the victim we think that generally this be the correct standardas early indicate the court of special appeal hold that a show of a reasonable apprehension of fear be essential under hazel to establish the element of the offense where the victim do not resist the court do not believe however that the evidence be legally sufficient to demonstrate the existence of a reasonable fear which overcome pat ability to resist in support of the court conclusion rusk maintain that the evidence show that pat voluntarily enter his apartment without be subject to a single threat nor a scintilla of force that she make no effort to run away nor do she scream for help that she never exhibit a will to resist and that her subjective reaction of fear to the situation in which she have voluntarily place herself be unreasonable and exaggerate rusk claim that his act be not reasonably calculate to overcome a will to resist that pat verbal resistance be not resistance within the contemplation of hazel that his allege menace look do not constitute a threat of force and that even have he pull pat to the bed and lightly choke her as she claim this action view in the context of the entire incident no prior threat have be make would be insufficient to constitute force or a threat of force or render the intercourse nonconsensualwe think the reversal of rusk conviction by the court of special appeal be in error for the fundamental reason so good express in the dissent opinion by judge wilner when he

the light much favorable to the prosecution any rational trier of fact can have find the essential element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt it be readily apparent to us that the trier of fact can rationally find that the element of force and nonconsent have be establish and that rusk be guilty of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt of course it be for the jury to observe the witness and their demeanor and to judge their credibility and weigh their testimony quite obviously the 246246 jury disbelieve rusk and believe pat testimony from her testimony the jury can have reasonably conclude that the take of her car key be intend by rusk to immobilize her alone late at night in a neighborhood with which she be not familiar that after pat have repeatedly refuse to enter his apartment rusk command in firm tone that she do so that pat be badly frighten and fear that rusk intend to rape her that unable to think clearly and believe that she have no other choice in the circumstance pat enter rusk apartment that once inside pat ask permission to leave but rusk tell her to stay that he then pull pat by the arm to the bed and undress her that pat be afraid that rusk would kill her unless she submit that she begin to cry and rusk then put his hand on her throat and begin lightly to choke her that pat ask him if he would let her go without kill her if she comply with his demand that rusk give a affirmative response after which she finally submittedjust where persuasion end and force begin in case like the present be essentially a factual issue to be resolve

of edward salvatore rusk be insufficient to convict him of rape i therefore respectfully dissentthe standard of appellate review in decide a question of sufficiency as the majority correctly note be whether after view the evidence in the light much favorable to the prosecution any rational trier of fact can have find the essential element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt jackson v virginia 443 us 307 319 99 sct 2781 61 led2d 560 1979 emphasis in original tichnell v state 287 md 695 415 a2d 830 1980 however it be equally good settle that when one of the essential element of a crime be not sustain by the evidence the conviction of the defendant cannot stand as a matter of lawthe majority in apply this standard conclude that n view of the evidence adduce at the trial the reasonableness of pat apprehension of fear be plainly a question of fact for the jury to determine in so conclude the majority have skip over the crucial issue it seem to me that whether the prosecutrixs fear be reasonable become a question only after the court determine that the defendant conduct under the circumstance be reasonably calculate to give rise to a fear on her part to the extent that she be unable to resist in other word the fear must stem from his articulable conduct and equally if not much importantly cannot be inconsistent with her own contemporaneous reaction to that conduct the conduct of the defendant in and of itself must clearly indicate force or the threat of force such as to overpower the prosecutrixs ability to resist or will to resist in my view there be no evidence to support the majoritys conclusion that the prosecutrix be force to submit to sexual intercourse certainly not fellatiothis court define rape in hazel v state 221 md 464 46869 157 a2d 922 1960 as the act of a man have unlawful carnal knowledge of a female over the age of ten year by force without the consent and against the will of the victim the court go on to declare that orce be a essential element of the crime and to justify a conviction the evidence must warrant a conclusion either that the victim resist and her resistance be overcome by force or that she be prevent from resist by threat to her safety 221 md at 469 we note that no particular amount of force either actual or constructive be require to constitute rape necessarily that fact must depend upon the prevail circumstance id however we hasten to add that f the act and threat of the defendant reasonably calculate to create in the mind of the victim have regard to the circumstance in which she place a real apprehension due to fear of imminent bodily harm serious enough to impair or overcome her will to resist then such act and threat be the equivalent of force idto avoid any confusion about the substantive law to be apply we far state in hazel that whilehe authority be by no mean in accord as to what degree of resistance be necessary to establish the absence of consent the generally accept doctrine seem to be that a female who be conscious and possess of her natural mental and physical power when the attack take place must have resist to the extent of her ability at the time unless it appear that she be overcome by number or so terrify by threat as to overcome her will to resist by way of illustration we cite certain case in state v thompson 227 nc 19 40 se2d 620 1946 the victim and her friend straughan be ride in a car which stall and can not be start again even with the help of the defendant who be stranger one of the defendant persuade straughan to accompany him down the road to get a chain for the purpose of tow the car after straughan and one defendant leave the other three forcibly take the victim from her car into a unfinished house a block away and each have intercourse with her the victim do not object to intercourse with the three defendant because she be frighten and afraid they would kill her in addition it be plainly a jury question whether the prosecutrix be n such place and position that resistance would have be useless 40 se2d at 625 quote mill v unite state 164 us 644 649 17 sct 210 41 lead 584 1879in state v dill 3 terry 533 40 a2d 443

begin walk home for gas leave his wife and two child in the car sometime late the defendant happen upon the scene and induce the wife to let him take her in his automobile for the purpose of overtake her husband along the road instead the defendant drive his car off the highway into a private lane when the car stop the wife get out of the car and attempt to flee but be overtake by the defendant who on the grass plot between the two highway lane have sexual intercourse with herthe trial judge in submit the case to the jury instruct them in part as followsin the absence of excuse circumstance it must be show that the woman do resend the attack make upon her in good faith and without pretense with a active determination to prevent the violation of her person and be not merely passive and perfunctory in her resistance in state v hoffman 228 wis 235 280 nw 357 1938 the complain witness enter the defendant car under friendly circumstance and be drive out into the country without protest when the defendant make his advance she shout she be go home pull away from him and run he catch up with her and there be a tussle she fall and try to kick him again she run and he catch her and say if you run again i will choke you and throw you in the ditch 280 nw at 360 after that she walk with him back to the car he do not order her to get in but beg her no force be use thereafter finally she consent and acquiesce in the event which follow at trial the complainant testify she be terribly frighten nevertheless the court concludedsuffice it to say that we have painstakingly read and reread her testimony with the result that in our opinion it fall far short of prove that resistance which our law require unless her failure to resist be excuse because of a fear of death or of great bodily harm or unless she be so terrify as to be unable to resist the defendant it be apparently concede by the state that her resistance be insufficient to prove the crime of rape unless her acquiescence or submission to the defendant be the result of that fear which our settle rule require from the testimony of the complain witness it appear that she be fully cognizant of everything that be go on fully able to relate every detail thereof and that she be in no reasonable sense dominate by that fear which excuse the utmost resistance within her powerwhile the evidence be good calculate to arouse keen indignation against the defendant who so persistently and importunately pursue the complain witness who at that time be a virgin it fall short in our opinion of prove a case of rape in selvage v state 148 neb 409 27 nw2d 636 1947 a 18yearold woman go to a dance with her brother and late decide to go to a cafe with the defendant and some other acquaintance they drive to a ball park several block

her to the grind hold her while they take turn have sexual intercourse while this be go on a car with its light on drive up and the two young man hurry some distance away from her she make no outcry nor attempt to communicate with the people in this car late at a different place in the park she claim each have intercourse with her again the three walk back to the cafe drink coffee and wait to get a car to take them to the city near her home when they finally get a car she testify the two repeat the act of intercourse with her she resist but make no complaint to that ride in the front seat when she get home she relate to her parent what have happenedthe supreme court of nebraska in hold the evidence insufficient to convict for rape saidresistance or opposition by mere word be not enough the resistance must be by act and must be reasonably proportionate to the strength and opportunity of the woman she must resist the consummation of the act and her resistance must not be a mere pretense but must be in good faith and must persist until the offense be consummate in kidd v state 97 okla crim 415 266 p2d 992 1953 the rape take place in a car in a isolate spot one assailant in that case tell the victim that if she do not shut up he would kill her with a beer bottle by the time take over the court conclude this victim be whip down and demoralize 266 p2d at 1001these case make plain that hazel intend to require clear and cognizable evidence of force or the threat of force sufficient to overcome or prevent resistance by the female before there would arise a jury question of whether the prosecutrix have a reasonable apprehension of harm the majority today depart from this requirement and place its imprimatur on the female conclusory statement that she be in fear as sufficient to support a conviction of rapeit be significant to note that in each of the fourteen report rape case decide since hazel in which sufficiency of the evidence be the issue the appellate court of this state have adhere to the requirement that evidence of force or the threat of force overcome or prevent resistance by the female must be demonstrate on the record to sustain a conviction in two of that case goldberg v state 41 md app 58 395 a2d 1213 certiorari dismiss as improvidently grant september 18 1979 and winegan v state 10 md app 196 268 a2d 585 1970 the conviction be reverse by the court of special appeal goldberg concern a student profess to be a talent agent who lure a young woman to a apartment upon the pretext of offer her a model job she freely accompany him and though she protest verbally she do not physically resist his advance the court of special appeal heldthe prosecutrix swear that the reason for her fear of be kill if she do not accede to appellant advance be twofold 1 she be alone with the appellant in a house with no building close by and no one to help her if she resist and 2 the appellant be much large than she be in the complete absence of any threaten word or action by the appellant this two factor as a matter of law be simply not enough to have create a reasonable fear of harm so as to preclude resistance and be the equivalent of force hazel v state supra at 469 without proof of force actual or constructive evidence by word or conduct of the defendant or that act in consort with him sexual intercourse be not rape in winegan the appellant conviction be reverse because although the prosecutrix accompany him to a board house and have sexual intercourse only because she think he have a gun he in fact have no gun nor at any time claim to have one it be on this basis couple with the fact that 1 the complainant at no time make outcry and 2 she follow him up the step to his room that the court conclude that her fear if actually present be so unreasonable as to preclude a conviction for rapeof the other twelve case four from this court not one contain the paucity of evidence regard force or threat of force which exist in the case sub judice in johnson jr v state 232 md 199 192 a2d 506 1963 the court state that although there be some evidence tend to indicate consent which stand alone may have justify a judgment of acquittal there be also evidence of violent act and verbal threat on the part of the appellant which if believe would have be the equivalent of such force as be reasonably calculate to create the apprehension of imminent bodily harm which can have impair or overcome the victim will to resist in that case the court relatedthe act allude to take place at the park car the jury have testimony before it that obscene remark and threat be direct to her and while they be lock in the car and that rock be throw at the window break them testify that one of the three man suggest shoot the victim may have submit to sexual relation but that do not necessarily imply consent in thompson v state 230 md 113 186 a2d 461 1962 the victim be murder and there be no question whether the act

appeal uphold a rape conviction in a case in which the victim be physically harm in the assault she receive substantial injury to her genital area require as note surgical suture this be force raw actual force unnecessary force force beyond that normally involve in complete the coital act 45 md app at 70 emphasis supply in addition the assailant make point and repeat reference to have a knife under the circumstance in which it be make be certainly calculate reasonably calculate to create in mind a real apprehension of serious and imminent bodily injury if she do not comply 45 md app at

into the victim home point a shotgun at her and tie her upin dive v state 33 md app 601 365 a2d 1009 1976 the victim try to run but be leap upon and smother when she fall there nothing to indicate she would not have be injure much substantially if she have continue to resist his advance 33 md app at 617along the same line be burnette v state 15 md app 371 290 a2d 816 1972 the victim be alone with appellant who in a lonely spot assault and beat her 15 md app at 377 and in coward v state 10 md app 127 268 a2d 508 cert deny 259 md 730 1970 the victim be drive to a wood area by two man and the driver threaten to break her neckin rice v state 9 md app 552 267 a2d 261 cert deny 259 md 735 1970 it be explain where as here a woman submit to a strange who have force his way into her home and manhandle her we do not look upon the case with the same eye as when intercourse occur after a initially friendly encounter 9 md app at 560and in walter v state 9 md app 385 264 a2d 882 cert deny 258 md 731 1970 and lucas v state 2 md app 590 235 a2d 780 cert deny 249 md 732 1968 the circumstance be also persuasive to show fear induce by force or threat in walter a police officer subdue a woman who realize he have a gun become hysterical she be also afraid of his abrupt tone of voice the court conclude that it be apparent the accuse deliberately place the victim in a situation where she would be afraid with the expectation she would thereby yield to his lustful demand without physical resistance 9 md app at 395 in lucas the perpetrator threaten the victim and her four infant child with a knifein each of the above 12 case there be either physical violence or specific threaten word or conduct which be calculate to create a very real and specific fear of immediate physical injury to the victim if she do not comply couple with the apparent power to execute that threat in the event of nonsubmissionwhile court no long require a female to resist to the utmost or to resist where resistance would be foolhardy they do require her acquiescence in the act of intercourse to stem from fear generate by something of substance she may not simply say i be really scare and thereby transform consent or mere unwillingness into submission by force this word do not transform a seducer into a rapist she must follow the natural instinct of every proud female to resist by much than mere word the violation of her person by a strange or a unwelcomed friend she must make it plain that she regard such sexual act as abhorrent and repugnant to her natural sense of pride she must resist unless the defendant have objectively manifest his intent to use physical force to accomplish his purpose the law regard rape as a crime of violence the majority today attenuate this proposition it declare the innocence of a at good distraught young woman it do not demonstrate the defendant guilt of the crime of rapemy examination of the evidence in a light much favorable to the state reveal no conduct by the defendant reasonably calculate to cause the prosecutrix to be so fearful that she should fail to resist and thus the element of force be lack in the state proofhere we have a full grow marry woman who meet the defendant in a bar under friendly circumstance they drink and talk together she agree to give him a ride home in her car when they arrive at his house locate in a area with which she be unfamiliar but which be certainly not isolate he invite her to come up to his apartment and she refuse accord to her testimony he take her key walk around to her side of the car and say now will you come up she answer yes the majority suggest that from her testimony the jury can have reasonably conclude that the take of her key be intend by rusk to immobilize her alone late at night in a neighborhood with which she be unfamiliar but on what fact do the majority so conclude there be no evidence descriptive of the tone of his voice her testimony indicate only the bare statement quote above how can the majority extract from this conduct a threat reasonably calculate to create a fear of imminent bodily harm there be no weapon no threat to inflict physical injuryshe also testify that she be afraid of the way he look and afraid of his statement come on up come on up but what can the majority conclude from this statement couple with a look that remain undescribed there be no evidence whatsoever to suggest that this be anything other than a pattern of conduct consistent with the ordinary seduction of a female acquaintance who at first suggest her disinclinationafter reach the room she describe what occur as followsi be still beg him to please let you know let me leave i say you can get a lot of other girl down there for what you want and he just keep say no and then i be really scare because i can not describe you know what be say it be much the look in his eye and i say at that point i do not know what to say and i say if i do what you want will you let me go without kill me because i do not know at that point what he be go to do and i start to cry and when i do he put his hand on my throat and start lightly to choke me and i say if i do what you want will you let me go and he say yes and at that time i proceed to do what he want me tothe majority rely on the trial court statement that the defendant respond affirmatively to her question if i do what you want will you let me go without kill me the majority far suggest that the jury can infer the defendant affirmative response the fact belie such inference since by the prosecutrixs own testimony the defendant make no response he say nothingshe then testify that she start to cry and he start lightly to choke her whatever that mean obviously the choke be not of any persuasive significance during this choke she be able to talk she say if i do what you want will you let me go it be at this point that the defendant say yesi find it incredible for the majority to conclude that on this fact without much a woman be force to commit oral sex upon the defendant and then to engage in vaginal intercourse in the absence of any verbal threat to do her grievous bodily harm or the display of any weapon and threat to use it i find it difficult to understand how a victim can participate in this sexual activity and not be willingwhat be the nature and extent of her fear anyhow she herself testify she be fearful that maybe i have someone follow me she be afraid because she do not know him and she be afraid he be go to rape her but there be no act or conduct on the part of the defendant to suggest that this fear be create by the defendant or that he make any objective identifiable threat to her which would give rise to this womans failure to flee summon help scream or make physical resistanceas the defendant good know this be not a child this be a marry woman with child a woman familiar with the social set in which this two actor meet it be a ordinary city street not a isolate spot he have not force his way into her car he have not take advantage of a difference in year or any state of intoxication or mental or physical incapacity on her part he do not grapple with her she get out of the car walk with him across the street and follow him up the stair to his room she certainly have to realize that they be not go upstairs to play scrabbleonce in the room she wait while he go to the bathroom where he stay for five minute in his absence the room be light but she do not seek a mean of escape she do not even try the door to determine if it be lock she waitedupon his return he turn off the light and pull her on the bed there be no suggestion or inference to be draw from her testimony that he yank her on the bed or in any manner physically abuse her by this conduct as a matter of fact there be no suggestion by her that he bruise or hurt her in any manner or that the choke be intend to be disablinghe then proceed to unbutton her blouse and her bra he do not rip her clothe off or use any great force than be necessary to unfasten her garment he do not even complete this procedure but request that she do it which she do because he ask me to however she not only remove her clothe but take his clothe off toothen for a while they lie together on the bed kiss though she say she do not return his kiss however without protest she then proceed to perform oral sex and late submit to vaginal intercourse after this activity be complete she ask to leave they dress and he walk her to her car and ask to see her again she indicate that perhaps they may meet at fell point he give her direction home and return to his apartment where the police find him late that morningthe record do not disclose the basis for this young womans misgiving about her experience with the defendant the only substantive fear she have be that she would be late arrive home the objective fact make it inherently improbable that the defendant conduct generate any fear for her physical wellbeingin my judgment the state fail to prove the essential element of force beyond a reasonable doubt and therefore the judgment of conviction should be reversedjudges smith and digges have authorize me to state that they concur in the view express hereinappendixin the follow case rape conviction be overturn because the requirement of force necessary to affirmatively demonstrate lack of consent be not strictly comply with or the fact be so sketchy or inherently improbable that this element can not be establish as a matter of law beyond a reasonable doubtin zamora v state 449 sw2d 43 tex crim app 1969 it be hold that the evidence be insufficient to sustain a conviction of rape by force and threat where the sixteenyearold prosecutrix who have be engage in sexual relation with the defendant stepfather for about six year go to his bedroom to take him coffee do not try to leave take off part of her clothe at his request make no outcry and do not resist in any way even though she know what be go to happen when she sit on the bed on appeal reference be make to certain threat which if sufficient would have excuse the complainant failure to resist the defendant threaten to put the girl in a juvenile home and to whip her young brother and sister if she tell her mother but the court explain the threat that be make occur after the allege act and be not make to cause the prosecutrix to yield but to prevent her from inform her mother 449 sw2d at 47 emphasis supply the conviction be reversedin people v bale 74 cal app2d 732 169 p2d 262 1946 the complain witness testify that she meet the appellant in a bar and late he physically force her into his car and drive off the evidence in this respect be sufficient to sustain a charge of kidnap appellant next drive the woman down the highway and stop the car off the road he come around to her side and make a remark to the effect that he would then find out what kind of woman she be 169 p2d at 264 she testify that she be afraid of the threat id the court concludedthere be a entire absence of evidence that she voice any objection make any appeal for help or try to fight or struggle there be no evidence of any force or threat by the appellant at that time and no substantial evidence of any apprehension of immediate bodily harm accompany by apparent power of execution the evidence material to his charge fail to show either any reasonable resistance or any reasonable excuse for its absence the old rule that there must be resistance to the utmost have be relax people v cline 117 cal app 181 3 p2d 575 but not to the extent of do away with the need of show some resistance or in proper case show fact which fairly indicate some good reason for not resist in farrar v unite state 275 f2d 868 dc cir1959 opinion amend 1960 the word of chief judge prettyman speak for the court be good leave to speak for themselvesas i understand the law of rape if no force be use and the girl in fact acquiesce the acquiescence may nevertheless be deem to be nonconsent if it be induce by fear but the fear to be sufficient for this purpose must be base upon something of substance and furthermore the fear must be of death or severe bodily harm a girl cannot simply say i be scare and thus transform a apparent consent into a legal nonconsent which make the man act a capital offense she must have a reasonable apprehension as i understand the law of something real her fear must be not fanciful but substantialin the case at bar there be a apparent acquiescence on the girl part she say she take off all her clothe lie down on the bed and have intercourse twice some fortyfive minute apart but she say she do this because she be scare and she be quite clear emphatic and insistent upon the cause of her fear the man have a knife in his hand the reason for her fear be tangible and definite it be a knife and it be in his hand she so testify repeatedlybut she never see any knife now it be perfectly apparent that if this man have have a knife in his hand while he be do all the thing she say he do over this two or three hour period she must have see it he can not have have a knife and have do all this thing with her watch him as she say she do without her see the knife as a matter of fact at the close of the government testimony the trial judge strike from the record all the testimony concern the knife leave her testimony in that it be something that feel sharp and feel like a knife the judge say if there have be a knife the girl would have see itupon the forego fact and circumstance when the knife disappear from the record as a possible fact the charge of rape disappear as i view the matter the only basis for fear advance by the prosecutrix be the knife she suggest no alternative cause for fear the only factual substance to any of the intangible threat allegedly make by him to her be the knife there be no force or violence and no threat or fear of force or violence except for the knife the charge of rape rest upon the presence of the knife the government fail to prove a case of rape in gonzales v state 516 p2d 592 wyo 1973 the complain witness be 33 year old and the divorce mother of three child she be work in a bar and defendant someone she know come in shortly before close and have be drink he ask her for a ride home and she refuse but he follow her and get into her car anyway she testify she be nervous and scare at the time and make no far protest nor signal with her horn on a side road e ask her to stop to go to the bathroom and take the key out of the ignition tell her she would not drive off and leave him she stay in the car 516 p2d at 593when he return he tell her he be go to rape her and she keep try to talk him out of it he tell her he be get mad at her and then put his fist against her face and say i be go to do it you can have it one way or the other there be no other threat the witness testify she know defendant temper and be scare of him she relate several previous incident to sustain her knowledge of his temper the court conclude this be not a firm basis upon which to sketch a man of violence and one who would inspire fear 516 p2d at 59394 it should be note that although the conviction be reverse on other ground the court conclude thatnasmuch as the case must be retry in conformity with this principle we do not deem it amiss to state it be not entirely fair to a trial court or to the defendant to rely on the sketchy show and lack of detail present at this trial there be a numb of other case in which the threat rely upon be find insufficient in state v horne 12 utah 2d 162 364 p2d 109 1961 the prosecutrix be a 21yearold marry woman with two young child they live in a trailer the defendant and she be acquaint and he have visit her on previous occasion on this particular night he enter her trailer uninvited and state he be go to make love to her she protest she struggle and her little girl who have be asleep in her mother bed awake and begin cry finally he let her go to the bathroom and she refuse to come out he come and get her and they struggle some much eventually she give in she testify she be afraid for her childrenthe court set forth the rule to be apply and apply it to the factsthe old rule of resistance to the utmost be obsolete the law do not require that the woman shall do much than her age strength the surround fact and all attend circumstance make reasonable for her to do in order to manifest her opposition however in determine the sufficiency of the evidence there must be consider the ease of assertion of the forcible accomplishment of the sexual act with impossibility of defense except by direct denial or of the proneness of the woman when she find the fact of her disgrace discover or likely of discovery to minimize her fault by assert force or violence which have lead court to hold to a very strict rule of proof in such casesthe prosecutrix do not attempt to leave the trailer to seek help although she have ample opportunity when she go to the bathroom the defendant accord to her testimony have already remove his pant and have make indecent proposal and advance yet she do not avail herself of the opportunity to seek help it be the natural impulse of every honest and virtuous female to flee from threaten outrage her explanation that she do not want to leave the child alone with the defendant be a rather weak one to say the less it would have take little than a minute to rouse her neighbor furthermore she leave the defendant with the child for 10 to 15 minute while she be in the bathroomthere be no evidence of any threat make to either the prosecutrix or her childrenwe have carefully evaluate the testimony of the prosecutrix and conclude that it be so inherently improbable as to be unworthy of belief and that upon objective analysis it appear that reasonable mind can not believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant be guilty the jurys verdict cannot stand in johnson v state 118 so2d 806 fla dist ct app 1960 the evidence be insufficient to sustain a jury find that the prosecutrix be force against her will to have intercourse with defendant or that her fear be sufficient for the jury to find that defendant be guilty of rape through fear in this case a eighteenyearold high school student accept a ride home from a acquaintance which eventually lead to her seduction at no time do the defendant threaten her with any weapon she scream but do not resist in any other way nor attempt to flee quote from state v remley 237 sw 489 492 mo 1922 the florida court statedthe statement of plaintiff as to this occurrence must be view in the light of all the surround fact and circumstance if the physical fact and all the circumstance appear in evidence together with the surround condition absolutely negative and destroy the force of such statement then in contemplation of law such statement do not amount to any substantial evidence of the fact to which they relate we do not mean by this fact that the prosecutrix must be corroborate for such be not the law of this state state v marcks 140 mo 656 but we do hold that statement make by a witness that be not only in conflict with the experience of common life and of the ordinary instinct and prompting of human nature but negative as good by the conduct of the witness and the condition and circumstance surround the occurrence to which they have application be not sufficient to support the grave and serious charge of rape and this be true whether the charge be make in either a civil or criminal proceed and in people v blevins 98 ill app2d 172 240 ne2d 434 1968 the evidence be insufficient where there be unexplained inconsistency in the prosecution case and the defendant be find peacefully asleep at the scene of the crime when arrestedeven in the close case which have be uphold by other jurisdiction there exist much evidence of threatinduced fear of imminent bodily harm than exist in the present casein brown v state 59 wis 200 207 nw2d 602 1973 the defendant threaten his victim with a water pistol she have reason to believe it be real and reason to believe he would shoot her if she do not complyin johnson v unite state 426 f2d 651 654 dc cir1970 the victim failure to resist be base on a general fear of her assailant who have drag her from her car keep his arm around her neck when they stop for gas drive her to a desert location and tell her it would be useless for her to scream because no one would hear emphasis in originalin brown v state 581 p2d 189 wyo 1978 the victim be treat very roughly and bruise she do not resist because she be three or four month pregnant which the defendant know and because she be afraid for both her own and her babys livesin tryon v state 567 p2d 290 wyo 1970 the victim do not resist out of fear although he do not threaten her the conviction be sustain the court explainedwe find here a child afraid of the dark alone with this defendant several mile from her home very late at night and with a man whom she know have be drink and quarrel with the woman for whom she have be babysitting we cannot help but suggest that all of this element can totally terrify a child of tender year or that the jury can have so reasonably inferredalthough the defendant do not express threat wield no weapon and do not strike the victim the force apply when consider in light of the fact previously relate be sufficient to support the jurys find of nonconsent section 464e
